HTTP request methods are the actions or commands a client (like a browser) sends to a server to indicate what it wants to do with a resource. They define the purpose of the request and how the server should respond. Here are the main HTTP methods:

### 1. **GET**

- Used to retrieve data from a server.
- Does not modify any data on the server.
- Often used to fetch web pages or resources.

### 2. **POST**

- Used to send data to the server to create or update resources.
- Often used in forms to submit user input like login details or file uploads.

### 3. **PUT**

- Used to update or create a resource on the server.
- If the resource doesn’t exist, it can be created.

### 4. **DELETE**

- Used to delete a resource on the server.

### 5. **PATCH**

- Used to partially update a resource on the server.
- Unlike PUT, it doesn’t require sending the entire resource.

### 6. **HEAD**

- Similar to GET but only retrieves the headers of a resource, not the content.
- Often used to check if a resource exists or to get metadata.

### 7. **OPTIONS**

- Used to describe the communication options available for a resource.
- Often used for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight requests.

### 8. **TRACE**

- Used for diagnostic purposes to see how a request is processed by the server.

### 9. **CONNECT**

- Used to establish a tunnel to the server, often for encrypted connections like HTTPS.

Each method serves a specific purpose and helps in structuring interactions between clients and servers effectively.
