Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to get updates from a server.

This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.

## Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications

The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:

```javascript
var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");  
source.onmessage = function(event) {  
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";  
};
```

Code in PHP `(demo_sse.php)`:

```php
<?php  
header('Content-Type: text/event-stream');  
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');  
  
$time = date('r');  
echo "data: The server time is: {$time}\n\n";  
flush();  
?>
```

Code in ASP (VB) (demo_sse.asp):
```asp
<%  
Response.ContentType = "text/event-stream"  
Response.Expires = -1  
Response.Write("data: The server time is: " & now())  
Response.Flush()  
%>
```

In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available:

| Events    | Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| onopen    | When a connection to the server is opened |
| onmessage | When a message is received                |
| onerror   | When an error occurs                      |
