A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

- Web pages
- Images
- Style sheets
- JavaScripts

## Absolute File Paths

An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:

```html
<img src="https://www.mountains.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
```

## Relative File Paths

A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:

```html
<img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
```

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:

```html
<img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
```

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

```html
<img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
```

## Best Practice

It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
