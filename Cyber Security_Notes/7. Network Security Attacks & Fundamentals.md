## 1. Introduction 

**Security Threat**

- A potential danger to an information system or asset.

**Security Vulnerability**

- A weakness in a system or its controls that could be exploited by a threat.

**Security Attack**

- An actual attempt to exploit a vulnerability by a threat.

**Security Risk**

- The potential for loss or harm resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability.


## 1. Network Security Attacks 

### Hacking Techniques

Hacking techniques are methods employed by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data. These techniques often exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or human behavior.

1. **Phishing**  
   - A social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities (e.g., banks, organizations) via emails, text messages, or fake websites to trick victims into sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.  
   - **Example**: An email claiming to be from a bank asking you to reset your password by clicking a fraudulent link.  

2. **Brute Force Attack**  
   - A method where attackers systematically try all possible combinations of passwords until they gain access.  
   - **Tools**: Hydra, John the Ripper.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Strong password policies, account lockout after failed attempts.  

3. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**  
   - A code injection attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into input fields, exploiting database vulnerabilities.  
   - **Example**: An attacker inputs `' OR '1'='1` in a login field to bypass authentication.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Input validation, parameterized queries.  

4. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**  
   - Attacks aimed at overwhelming a server, network, or website with traffic to make it unavailable to legitimate users.  
   - **DDoS** amplifies this using multiple compromised systems (botnets).  
   - **Countermeasures**: Firewalls, DDoS protection services like Cloudflare.  

5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**  
   - An attacker intercepts and relays communication between two parties without their knowledge.  
   - **Example**: Intercepting data on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.  
   - **Countermeasures**: HTTPS, VPNs, strong encryption.  

6. **Zero-Day Exploits**  
   - Attacks that target vulnerabilities unknown to software developers, giving attackers a head start before a patch is developed.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular software updates, intrusion detection systems.  

7. **Ransomware**  
   - Malware that encrypts a victim's files, with attackers demanding payment (ransom) to restore access.  
   - **Example**: WannaCry ransomware attack.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular backups, endpoint protection tools.  

8. **Keylogging**  
   - Software or hardware that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information like usernames and passwords.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Anti-keylogging software, virtual keyboards.

### Network and Social Engineering Attacks 

1. **Social Engineering**  
   - Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information through psychological tactics.  
   - **Common Techniques**:  
     - **Pretexting**: Creating a fabricated scenario to gain trust.  
     - **Baiting**: Offering something enticing (e.g., a free USB drive) to lure victims.  
     - **Tailgating**: Gaining physical access by following someone with authorized access.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Employee training, multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

2. **Eavesdropping Attack**  
   - Intercepting network communications to steal data.  
   - **Example**: Sniffing unencrypted data on public Wi-Fi.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Secure Wi-Fi, encryption.  

3. **DNS Spoofing**  
   - Altering DNS records to redirect traffic from legitimate sites to malicious ones.  
   - **Example**: Redirecting bank website users to a phishing site.  
   - **Countermeasures**: DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions).  

4. **Replay Attacks**  
   - Replaying valid data transmissions to impersonate a user or system.  
   - **Example**: Re-sending a previously intercepted authentication token.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Timestamping, unique session IDs.  

5. **ARP Spoofing**  
   - An attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with another device's IP address, enabling MITM attacks.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Static ARP entries, packet inspection.  

6. **Watering Hole Attack**  
   - Compromising a specific website or resource frequently visited by the target group to infect them with malware.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular website security audits, endpoint protection.
