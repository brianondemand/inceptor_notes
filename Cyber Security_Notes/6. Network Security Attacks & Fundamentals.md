## 1. Network Security Attacks 

### **Hacking Techniques**  

Hacking techniques are methods employed by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data. These techniques often exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or human behavior.

1. **Phishing**  
   - A social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities (e.g., banks, organizations) via emails, text messages, or fake websites to trick victims into sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.  
   - **Example**: An email claiming to be from a bank asking you to reset your password by clicking a fraudulent link.  

2. **Brute Force Attack**  
   - A method where attackers systematically try all possible combinations of passwords until they gain access.  
   - **Tools**: Hydra, John the Ripper.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Strong password policies, account lockout after failed attempts.  

3. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**  
   - A code injection attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into input fields, exploiting database vulnerabilities.  
   - **Example**: An attacker inputs `' OR '1'='1` in a login field to bypass authentication.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Input validation, parameterized queries.  

4. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**  
   - Attacks aimed at overwhelming a server, network, or website with traffic to make it unavailable to legitimate users.  
   - **DDoS** amplifies this using multiple compromised systems (botnets).  
   - **Countermeasures**: Firewalls, DDoS protection services like Cloudflare.  

5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**  
   - An attacker intercepts and relays communication between two parties without their knowledge.  
   - **Example**: Intercepting data on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.  
   - **Countermeasures**: HTTPS, VPNs, strong encryption.  

6. **Zero-Day Exploits**  
   - Attacks that target vulnerabilities unknown to software developers, giving attackers a head start before a patch is developed.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular software updates, intrusion detection systems.  

7. **Ransomware**  
   - Malware that encrypts a victim's files, with attackers demanding payment (ransom) to restore access.  
   - **Example**: WannaCry ransomware attack.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular backups, endpoint protection tools.  

8. **Keylogging**  
   - Software or hardware that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information like usernames and passwords.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Anti-keylogging software, virtual keyboards.

### **Network and Social Engineering Attacks**  

1. **Social Engineering**  
   - Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information through psychological tactics.  
   - **Common Techniques**:  
     - **Pretexting**: Creating a fabricated scenario to gain trust.  
     - **Baiting**: Offering something enticing (e.g., a free USB drive) to lure victims.  
     - **Tailgating**: Gaining physical access by following someone with authorized access.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Employee training, multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

2. **Eavesdropping Attack**  
   - Intercepting network communications to steal data.  
   - **Example**: Sniffing unencrypted data on public Wi-Fi.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Secure Wi-Fi, encryption.  

3. **DNS Spoofing**  
   - Altering DNS records to redirect traffic from legitimate sites to malicious ones.  
   - **Example**: Redirecting bank website users to a phishing site.  
   - **Countermeasures**: DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions).  

4. **Replay Attacks**  
   - Replaying valid data transmissions to impersonate a user or system.  
   - **Example**: Re-sending a previously intercepted authentication token.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Timestamping, unique session IDs.  

5. **ARP Spoofing**  
   - An attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate their MAC address with another device's IP address, enabling MITM attacks.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Static ARP entries, packet inspection.  

6. **Watering Hole Attack**  
   - Compromising a specific website or resource frequently visited by the target group to infect them with malware.  
   - **Countermeasures**: Regular website security audits, endpoint protection.

## 2. Network Fundamentals  

### **Basics of Network Security**  

1. **What is Network Security?**  
   - A set of practices and technologies designed to protect networks from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction.  

2. **Key Principles of Network Security**  
   - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals.  
   - **Integrity**: Ensuring data is not altered during storage or transmission.  
   - **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.  

3. **Network Security Layers**  
   - **Perimeter Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).  
   - **Endpoint Security**: Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR).  
   - **Data Security**: Encryption, access controls.  

4. **Common Network Security Tools**  
   - **Firewalls**: Block unauthorized traffic.  
   - **VPNs**: Encrypt data for secure remote access.  
   - **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Monitor and block malicious activity.  
   - **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging and analysis of security events.

### **Network Protocols and Encryption Techniques**  

1. **What are Network Protocols?**  
   - Rules and standards that define how data is transmitted across a network.  

2. **Common Network Protocols**  
   - **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for web communication. HTTPS adds encryption (TLS).  
   - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used to transfer files, often replaced by more secure protocols like SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).  
   - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used to send emails. Encrypted versions include SMTPS or email encryption using TLS.  
   - **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
   - **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The foundational protocol suite for internet communication, ensuring reliable data delivery.  
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A lightweight, faster protocol than TCP but does not guarantee data delivery.  

3. **Encryption Techniques**  

   - **Symmetric Encryption**  
     - The same key is used for encryption and decryption.  
     - Faster but requires secure key sharing.  
     - **Example Algorithms**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).  

   - **Asymmetric Encryption**  
     - Uses a pair of keys: public (for encryption) and private (for decryption).  
     - **Example Algorithms**: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).  
     - Commonly used for secure key exchanges and digital signatures.  

   - **Hashing**  
     - Converts data into a fixed-length hash value, primarily for data integrity verification.  
     - Hash functions are one-way and cannot be reversed.  
     - **Example Algorithms**: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), MD5 (Message Digest 5).  

4. **Modern Encryption Standards**  
   - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used symmetric encryption standard with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.  
   - **RSA**: Commonly used asymmetric encryption method, especially for secure communications like HTTPS.  
   - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Provides equivalent security to RSA but with shorter key lengths, making it faster and more efficient.  

5. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**  
   - TLS (and its predecessor SSL) is used to secure communication over the internet. It ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity.  
   - **Common Use**: HTTPS websites, email servers.  

6. **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**  
   - A suite of protocols for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet.  
   - **Commonly used in VPNs**.
