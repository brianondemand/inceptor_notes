Wireshark is one of the most powerful network traffic analyzers. It can be used to view network traffic, analyze packet data, and identify any problematic or malicious activity.

Wireshark does three things:

1. **Packet Capture:** Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
2. **Filtering:** Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
3. **Visualization:** Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

### Wireshark User Interface

When you first open Wireshark you’ll be presented with the start screen.

There are four primary areas to the start screen, some of which will carry over into the working screen once you pick an interface to work capture traffic from.

### 2. Main Toolbar

![][image]

This is a quick access toolbar providing easy to use buttons for the most common functions of the main menu. Most of these buttons become active only after you’ve selected an interface to monitor.

### 3. Filter Toolbar

This toolbar allows you to quickly edit and apply display filters to your capture. Display filters allow you to narrow down the packets that you’ve captured to only those that are relevant to what you’re trying to see such as specific IP address sources and destinations, protocols, MAC addresses, etc…

![Screenshot of the wireshark filter toolbar with descriptions detailing each button and section.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-filter-toolbar-button-diagram.png)

### 4. Interface List

![Screenshot of the wireshark interface list showing the important sections of the start screen.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-interface-list-diagram.png)

The Interface List is the area where the interfaces that your device has installed will appear. Before you can see packet data you need to pick one of the interfaces by clicking on it. You can choose a capture filter and type of interface to show in the interfaces lists at this screen as well.

Clicking on and interface or opening an existing capture file will take you to the working screen:

![Screenshot of the working screen within Wireshark with arrows pointing to each primary section.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/diagram-wireshark-working-user-interface-ui.png)

**Primary Areas of the Wireshark Working Screen**:

1. Title Bar
2. Packet List Panel
3. Intelligent Scrollbar
4. Packet Details Panel
5. Packet Bytes Panel
6. The Status Bar

### 1. Title Bar

This bar shows the name of the interface you’re capturing until you save your capture. Then it will show the name of the capture dump file. If you open a saved capture file its’ name will be displayed here.

### 2. Packet List Panel

![Screenshot of the wireshark packet list pane illustrating the different elements.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-packet-list-pane-user-interface-ui.png)

Every line in this pane represents one packet. By default, the pane is broken up into 7 columns, each of which provides useful identification data for each packet and can be sorted to help you better dissect the data. You can remove, add, and reorder the columns to suit your needs. Selecting a packet will show more details in the Packet Details Pane and Packet Bytes Pane.

**No**.
The No. column assigns a unique number to each packet. It can also display a symbol to help identify the relationship between packets if you click on a packet.

**Time**
Displays the timestamp for when the packet was captured. The format of this timestamp is customizable.

**Source**
Displays the source IP or MAC address that the packet originated from.

**Destination**
Displays the destination IP or MAC address that the packet was heading to.

**Protocol**
Displays abbreviated protocol information for the packet.

**Length**
Displays the packet length.

**Info**
Displays additional information related to the packet.

### 3. Intelligent Scrollbar

![Screenshot of the Wireshark Intelligent Scrollbar with an Arrow illustrating the location and colors of the scrollbar.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-intelligent-scrollbar-user-interface-ui.png)

To the right of the Packet List Pane is a colored bar called the Intelligent Scrollbar which is a mini-map of packets. Every line of the Intelligent Scrollbar is a raster line that represents a single packet. The number of packets displayed depends on the height of the list and your physical display’s specifications.

This list makes it easy to jump to packets based on colorization. It also makes it easy to spot groups of specific types of packets especially if you utilize custom coloring rules.

### 4. Packet Details Panel

![Screenshot of the packet detail pane within Wireshark illustrating the different types of data displayed.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-packet-details-pane-user-interface-ui.png)

When you click on a packet in the Packet List Pane it loads data about that packet in the Packet Details Pane. This pane displays the packet’s different protocols and protocol fields. This is list is displayed as a tree that can be expanded to show even more detail.

The details can also include a couple special fields that Wireshark generates on its’ own by analyzing the packets. The two fields are Generated Fields and Links.

### Generated Fields

This information is enclosed in brackets ([ ]) and contains info such as TCP analysis, response time, checksum validation, and IP geolocation.

### Links

Wireshark will generate a link if it detects relationships between packets. These links will be formatted blue with an underline. Double-clicking on the link will jump you to the related packet.

There is also a context menu which you can access by right clicking within the pane.

### 5. Packet Bytes Panel

![Screenshot of the packet bytes pane within Wireshark illustrating the different types of data displayed.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-packet-bytes-pane-user-interface-ui.png)

When you click on a packet in the Packet List Pane it loads data about the packet in the Packet Bytes Pane as well. This data is in a hexdump style with each line displaying the data offset, 16 hexadecimal bytes, and 16 ASCII bytes. The periods represent non-printable bytes.

If you mouse over a specific piece of data Wireshark will highlight the corresponding data which you see in the example above in blue where the hex bytes are highlighted along with the associated ASCII bytes.

Occasionally, when Wireshark reassembles some packets into a single chunk or decrypts data, there will be multiple pages tabbed at the bottom of the Packet Bytes Pane.

There is also a context menu which you can access by right clicking within the pane.

### 6. Status Bar

![Screenshot of the statusbar at the bottom of Wireshark illustrating the different details shown within the bar.](https://networkproguide.com/wp-content/uploads/wireshark-statusbar-user-interface-ui.png)

The status bar contains informational messages.

### The Colorized Bullet

At the far left of the status bar is a colorized bullet which represents the highest Expert Level. When moused over it displays the Expert Infos box.

### The Capture File Properties Button

To the right of the colorized bullet is the capture file properties dialog button.

### The Left Side

In most circumstances the left side will show contextual information about the capture file such as it’s size, name, time elapsed. Hovering over the capture file details will show the path to the file.

### The Middle

The middle will show info related to the current capture file such a the packet counts and load time.

### The Right Side

The right will show the current configuration profile being used.

If you use a display filter that has a problem, it will also be displayed in the Capture File Details field of the status bar.

## Analyzing Captured Data

### Understanding Packet Information

Once you begin capturing data with Wireshark, it displays the total number of captured packets at the bottom of the screen. Initially, you will see all packets displayed but, by using filters, you can drill down to view only the important packets.

Each row on the screen represents a single packet, showcasing the exchange of information over the network during activities like browsing a website or transferring files.

### The Importance of Filtering

Your network is constantly buzzing with packet transfers, not just from your activities but also from IoT and smart devices maintaining their connection to the network. The challenge in using Wireshark lies in filtering out the noise—identifying packets that aren’t immediately relevant to your current analysis objective. Wireshark offers tools to give you a comprehensive overview of network activity, enabling you to narrow down and examine the specific packets you need to analyze further.

### Wireshark Filters for TCP 3-Way Handshake

A TCP 3-way handshake consists of three packets:

1. **SYN** – Client initiates connection
2. **SYN-ACK** – Server acknowledges
3. **ACK** – Client completes the handshake

**Wireshark Filter for Capturing the 3-Way Handshake**

```plaintext
tcp.flags.syn == 1 || tcp.flags.ack == 1
```

- Captures both `SYN` and `ACK` packets.
- Useful for monitoring new connections.

**More Specific Filters:**

**1. Capture Only SYN Packets (Connection Attempts)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x02
```

- Shows only TCP `SYN` packets.

**2. Capture Only SYN-ACK Packets (Server Responses)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x12
```

- Shows TCP `SYN-ACK` responses from the server.

**3. Capture Only Final ACK (Completion of Handshake)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x10
```

- Shows TCP `ACK` packets completing the handshake.

**4. Capture Full 3-Way Handshake for a Specific IP**

```plaintext
(ip.addr == 192.168.1.100) && (tcp.flags.syn == 1 || tcp.flags.ack == 1)
```

- Replace `192.168.1.100` with the IP of interest.

**Detecting Suspicious TCP Handshakes (Possible Scanning)**

- If you see a lot of `SYN` packets **without** `SYN-ACK`, this could indicate a **SYN flood attack**.
- Use the following filter to detect such behavior:


    ```plaintext
    tcp.flags.syn == 1 && !tcp.flags.ack == 1
    ```

### Wireshark Filters for Pentesting & Credential Capture on HTTP

#### 1. Capture Credentials in an HTTP Form

Since HTTP traffic is unencrypted, credentials sent in a form can often be captured in plaintext.

**Wireshark Display Filter:**

```plaintext
http.request.method == "POST"
```

- This captures all HTTP POST requests, where credentials are usually submitted.
- To narrow it down to login pages, look for parameters like `username`, `password`, `email`, etc.

**Additional Filter for Specific Host:**

```plaintext
http.host contains "targetwebsite.com"
```

- Replace `targetwebsite.com` with the domain you are testing.

**To View Data Inside the Packet:**

1. Right-click on a packet → Follow → HTTP Stream
   
2. Look for form parameters such as:

    ```
    username=admin&password=123456
    ```


#### 2. Other Pentesting Wireshark Filters

**a) Capture Unencrypted Passwords in HTTP Traffic**

```plaintext
http contains "password"
```

- Filters HTTP packets containing the keyword "password".

**b) Capture FTP Login Credentials (Plaintext)**

```plaintext
ftp.request.command == "USER" || ftp.request.command == "PASS"
```

- Shows usernames and passwords sent via FTP (which are in plaintext).

**c) Capture Telnet Sessions (Plaintext Credentials)**

```plaintext
telnet
```

- Filters all Telnet traffic, which transmits data in plaintext.

**d) Detect Suspicious DNS Queries (Potential C2 Communication)**

```plaintext
dns.qry.name contains "malicious.com"
```

- Replace `malicious.com` with any suspected domain.

**e) Detect ARP Spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks)**

```plaintext
arp.duplicate-address-detected
```

- Identifies duplicate IP-MAC mappings, a sign of ARP spoofing.

**f) Capture ICMP Traffic (Ping Sweeps & Network Scanning)**

```plaintext
icmp
```

- Useful for detecting reconnaissance activities.

**g) Capture Suspicious SSH Connections**

```plaintext
tcp.port == 22 && tcp.flags.push == 1
```

- Identifies SSH traffic where data is actively transmitted.

**h) Capture Traffic from a Specific IP (e.g., Attacker’s Machine)**

```plaintext
ip.src == 192.168.1.100
```

- Replace `192.168.1.100` with the attacker's IP.
