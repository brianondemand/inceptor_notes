VPNs and proxy servers both protect user identities and are great tools for accessing content securely.

A VPN and a proxy are online services that hide your IP address by rerouting your internet traffic through a remote server. 

But a proxy works only with a single app or service, while a VPN secures all your internet traffic and encrypts it for extra security and privacy.

# VPN

A VPN will hide your IP address when you first connect to the server and replace it with the VPN provider’s IP address. 

A VPN  reroutes your internet traffic through a remote server and hides your IP address so websites can’t see your original IP or location, keeping your online activity private.

It works on the operating system level, meaning that it redirects all your traffic, whether it’s coming from your browser or a background app.

A VPN client also encrypts your traffic between the internet and your device. That means the Internet Service Provider (ISP) monitoring your internet activity and collecting data about you can no longer see what you’re doing online — just that you’re connected to a VPN server. 

The encryption also protects you from government surveillance, website tracking, and any snoopers or hackers who might try to intercept your device.

### Corporate VPN

Corporate VPNs are used by businesses to protect users and their devices, regardless of where employees connect to these devices.

### Individual VPN

These are services that are meant for individual use.

# Proxy

A proxy is suitable for internet browsing, but it won’t give you the level of security and the advanced features a VPN offers.

**Proxy servers** act as relays between the website you’re visiting and your device. Your traffic goes through a middle-man, a remote machine used to connect you to the host server.

A proxy server can also be called a **forward proxy**.

The **web proxy server** hides your original IP address so that the website sees the IP of the proxy (in some cases, the computers of other proxy users are used for this).

**Reverse proxy**:  is a type of proxy server that hides the IP addresses of the backend servers or origin servers. However, proxies only work on the application level, meaning it only reroutes the traffic coming from a single app you set your proxy up with. They also don’t encrypt your traffic.


There are three main types of proxy servers:

**HTTP Proxies**. These only cater to web pages. If you set up your browser with an HTTP proxy server, all your browser traffic will be rerouted through it.

**SOCKS Proxies**. These proxies are not limited to web traffic but still only work on the application level. Although they can handle all kinds of traffic, they are usually slower than HTTP proxies because they are more popular and often have a higher load.

**Transparent proxies**. These are a different kind of proxy because their users are usually unaware of their existence. These proxies can be set up by employers or parents who want to monitor users’ online activity and block access to specific websites. Hotels and cafes use them to authenticate users on public Wi-Fi and companies or home users might also set them up to save bandwidth.


Some services also offer private proxies, but these aren’t private the way a VPN is. Instead, they offer the user a single IP address that only they can use.


## Other Types of Proxies

### Forward proxy

A forward proxy sits in front of clients and is used to get data to groups of users within an internal network. When a request is sent, the proxy server examines it to decide whether it should proceed with making a connection.

A forward proxy is best suited for internal networks that need a single point of entry. It provides IP address security for those in the network and allows for straightforward administrative control. However, a forward proxy may limit an organization’s ability to cater to the needs of individual end-users.

### Transparent proxy

A transparent proxy can give users an experience identical to what they would have if they were using their home computer. In that way, it is “transparent.” They can also be “forced” on users, meaning they are connected without knowing it.

Transparent proxies are well-suited for companies that want to make use of a proxy without making employees aware they are using one. It carries the advantage of providing a seamless user experience. On the other hand, transparent proxies are more susceptible to certain security threats, such as SYN-flood denial-of-service attacks.

### Anonymous proxy

An anonymous proxy focuses on making internet activity untraceable. It works by accessing the internet on behalf of the user while hiding their identity and computer information.

A transparent proxy is best suited for users who want to have full anonymity while accessing the internet. While transparent proxies provide some of the best identity protection possible, they are not without drawbacks. Many view the use of transparent proxies as underhanded, and users sometimes face pushback or discrimination as a result.

### High anonymity proxy

A high anonymity proxy is an anonymous proxy that takes anonymity one step further. It works by erasing your information before the proxy attempts to connect to the target site.

A high anonymity proxy server is best suited for users for whom anonymity is an absolute necessity, such as employees who do not want their activity traced back to the organization. On the downside, some of them, particularly the free ones, are decoys set up to trap users in order to access their personal information or data.

### Distorting proxy

A distorting proxy identifies itself as a proxy to a website but hides its own identity. It does this by changing its IP address to an incorrect one.

Distorting proxies are a good choice for people who want to hide their location while accessing the internet. This type of proxy can make it look like you are browsing from a specific country and give you the advantage of hiding not just your identity but that of the proxy, too. This means even if you are associated with the proxy, your identity is still secure. However, some websites automatically block distorting proxies, which could keep an end-user from accessing sites they need.

### Data center proxy

Data center proxies are not affiliated with an internet service provider (ISP) but are provided by another corporation through a data center. The proxy server exists in a physical data center, and the user’s requests are routed through that server.

Data center proxies are a good choice for people who need quick response times and an inexpensive solution. They are therefore a good choice for people who need to gather intelligence on a person or organization very quickly. They carry the benefit of giving users the power to swiftly and inexpensively harvest data. On the other hand, they do not offer the highest level of anonymity, which may put users’ information or identity at risk.

### Residential proxy

A residential proxy gives you an IP address that belongs to a specific, physical device. All requests are then channeled through that device.

Residential proxies are well-suited for users who need to verify the ads that go on their website, so you can block suspicious or unwanted ads from competitors or bad actors. Residential proxies are more trustworthy than other proxy options. However, they often cost more money to use, so users should carefully analyze whether the benefits are worth the extra investment.

### Public proxy

A public proxy is accessible by anyone free of charge. It works by giving users access to its IP address, hiding their identity as they visit sites. 

Public proxies are best suited for users for whom cost is a major concern and security and speed are not. Although they are free and easily accessible, they are often slow because they get bogged down with free users. When you use a public proxy, you also run an increased risk of having your information accessed by others on the internet.

### Shared proxy

Shared proxies are used by more than one user at once. They give you access to an IP address that may be shared by other people, and then you can surf the internet while appearing to browse from a location of your choice.

Shared proxies are a solid option for people who do not have a lot of money to spend and do not necessarily need a fast connection. The main advantage of a shared proxy is its low cost. Because they are shared by others, you may get blamed for someone else’s bad decisions, which could get you banned from a site.

### SSL proxy

A secure sockets layer (SSL) proxy provides decryption between the client and the server. As the data is encrypted in both directions, the proxy hides its existence from both the client and the server.

These proxies are best suited for organizations that need enhanced protection against threats that the SSL protocol reveals and stops. Because Google prefers servers that use SSL, an SSL proxy, when used in connection with a website, may help its search engine ranking. On the downside, content encrypted on an SSL proxy cannot be cached, so when visiting websites multiple times, you may experience slower performance than you would otherwise.
