# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is gathering information about a target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 

This can involve various techniques such as analyzing publicly available information about the target, using tools to scan the target's network and systems for open ports and services, and trying to gather information about the target's employees and business practices.

The goal of reconnaissance is to gather as much information as possible about the target to create a detailed profile of the system or network and identify any potential weaknesses that can be exploited. This information can then be used to plan and execute a successful attack on the target.

## Types of Reconnaissance

### Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves interacting with the target system or network to gather information. 

This includes techniques such as running a port scan on the server to identify open ports and services, attempting to access restricted pages or resources within the application, or using tools to try and identify vulnerabilities within the application or underlying system.

### Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance is gathering information from publicly available sources without actively interacting with the target system or network. 

This includes techniques such as analyzing the target application's website and social media presence, looking up information about the application's developers and users, and reviewing publicly available documents such as user manuals and support documentation.


### Advantages of Active Reconnaissance

1. **Identify active systems and services**: Active reconnaissance allows you to identify which systems and services are actively running and responding to requests, rather than just those configured or present on the network.
2. **Comprehensive information gathering**: Active reconnaissance allows you to gather more information about a target system or network. You can interact with the system directly and probe it for information. This can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may not be detectable through passive reconnaissance methods.
3. **Gather real-time information**: Active reconnaissance allows you to gather information about a target system or network in real time, rather than relying on outdated or historical data. This can be useful for identifying current vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.

### Disadvantages of Active Reconnaissance

1. **Risk of detection**: Active reconnaissance involves actively interacting with the target system or network, which increases the risk of being detected by the target. This can trigger security alerts or defensive measures, disrupting the reconnaissance process.
2. **Risk of disruption**: Active reconnaissance can also disrupt the target system or network, disrupting the target's operations and potentially causing damage. This can be especially risky if the target is a critical infrastructure or has high-security requirements.
3. **Increased time and resources**: Active reconnaissance can be more time-consuming and resource-intensive than passive reconnaissance, as it involves actively interacting with the target and may require specialized tools and techniques.

### Advantages of Passive Reconnaissance

1. **Lower risk of detection**: Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information from publicly available sources without actively interacting with the target system or network, which reduces the risk of being detected by the target. This can be especially useful in cases where the target has high-security requirements or is sensitive to disruptions.
2. **Lower risk of disruption**: Passive reconnaissance also involves a smaller risk of disrupting the target system or network, as it does not involve actively interacting with the target.
3. **Lower resource requirements**: Passive reconnaissance is generally less resource-intensive than active reconnaissance, as it does not require specialized tools or techniques and can often be done using readily available information.

### Disadvantages of Passive Reconnaissance

1. **Less accurate and comprehensive information**: Passive reconnaissance relies on publicly available information, which may need to be more detailed and precise than information gathered through active reconnaissance.
2. **Limited ability to identify vulnerabilities**: Passive reconnaissance does not involve actively interacting with the target, which limits the ability to use tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Limited control over reconnaissance process**: With passive reconnaissance, the security team is limited to the information that is publicly available and has less control over the process than with active reconnaissance.

## Reverse IP Check

Checks for the ip address of a domain.

```
host google.com
```



## Extract Domain Registration Information 


## `whois`

The `whois` tool in **Kali Linux** is a command-line utility used to query domain registration and ownership information from **WHOIS databases**. It helps gather details about a domain name, such as the registrar, registrant contact details, creation and expiration dates, name servers, and more.

The Whois database contains details such as the registration date of the domain name, when it expires, ownership and contact information, nameserver information of the domain, the registrar via which the domain was purchased, etc.

###  How to Use the `whois` 

 **Basic WHOIS Query**

```
whois google.com
```


ðŸ”¹ Retrieves registration details for `google.com`.

---

**WHOIS Query for an IP Address**

```
whois 8.8.8.8
```

ðŸ”¹ Displays information about the owner of the IP address.

---

 **Using WHOIS with a Different WHOIS Server**

```
whois -h whois.arin.net 8.8.8.8
```

ðŸ”¹ Queries the **ARIN WHOIS server** for the IP address details.

---

**Checking Domain WHOIS with a Specific TLD Registry**

```
whois -h whois.verisign-grs.com google.com
```

ðŸ”¹ Queries **Verisign's WHOIS server** (used for `.com` and `.net` domains).

---

Some Registrars offer privacy protection services that allow their customers to mask their actual contact details in the Whois search result in order to prevent their private contact information falling into the hands of spammers and scammers. Get in touch with your Registrar to learn more about your options.
