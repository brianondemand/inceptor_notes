Network security comprises of the measures adopted to protect the resources and integrity of a computer network.

A network typically holds many applications, some which holds simple logins and others with complex functionality. One way to gain an overview of the attack surface, and also map out easy to exploit vulnerabilities, is to port scan all the assets in the target environment, then screenshot them.

Network Scanning in ethical hacking is a network exploration technique used to identify the systems connected to an organization’s network. It provides information about the accessible systems, services, and resources on a target system. 

There are two ways of scanning: 

- Active Scanning
- Passive Scanning

Scanning allows you to identify open ports on the target system and can be used for port mapping, performing an interactive session with the operating system via those ports, or even redirecting traffic from these open ports. There are many tasks that can be performed with a scanning tool.

#### Active Scanning

Active scanning is a type of network scanning technique that is used to gather information about a target system or network. Unlike passive scanning, which only gathers information that is readily available, active scanning actively interacts with the target system to gather information.

It involves sending requests or packets to a target system and analyzing the responses to gather information about the target. This type of scanning is more aggressive and intrusive than passive scanning and is often used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a target system or network.

**Active Network Scanning Tools**  

- **Nmap** – Most popular tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
- **Masscan** – Extremely fast port scanner, capable of scanning the entire internet.
- **Zmap** – Single-packet network scanner designed for high-speed scanning.
- **Angry IP Scanner** – Simple and fast scanner for detecting live hosts.
- **Unicornscan** – Advanced reconnaissance tool with asynchronous scanning.
- **Nikto** – Web server scanner that checks for vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploit** – Penetration testing framework with built-in scanning tools.
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability scanner used for security assessments.
- **Acunetix** – Web vulnerability scanner with automated scanning capabilities.
- **Scapy** – Python-based packet manipulation tool for scanning, sniffing, and forging packets.
- **hping** – Advanced TCP/IP packet generator useful for scanning and penetration testing.
- **ping** – Simple ICMP echo request tool to check network connectivity.
- **tracert (Windows) / traceroute (Linux/macOS)** – Tracks the path packets take to a destination.


#### Passive Scanning

Passive scanning is a type of network scanning technique that is used to gather information about a target system or network without actively interacting with the target. Unlike active scanning, which sends requests or packets to the target and analyzes the responses, passive scanning only gathers information that is readily available, such as information transmitted over the network or stored in system logs.

It is used to gather information about a target system or network for a variety of purposes, including network mapping, vulnerability assessment, and compliance testing. By analyzing network traffic and system logs, passive scanning can provide valuable information about a target’s infrastructure, servers, and devices, as well as the types of services and applications that are running.

**Passive Network Scanning Tools**  

- **Wireshark** – Packet sniffer and network protocol analyzer.
- **tcpdump** – Command-line packet capture tool for network traffic analysis.
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)** – Network monitoring and security analysis tool.
- **Suricata** – Intrusion detection and prevention system with deep packet inspection.
- **Snort** – Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for real-time traffic analysis.
- **Arkime (formerly Moloch)** – Large-scale, full-packet capture system.
- **PRADS (Passive Real-time Asset Detection System)** – Network asset and service discovery tool.
- **P0f** – Passive fingerprinting tool that detects OS and network characteristics.
- **NetFlow / sFlow / IPFIX** – Traffic monitoring protocols supported by many networking tools.
- **ARP Tables** – Checking ARP cache to identify devices connected to a local network without active scanning.

## Types of Network Attacks

Modern organizations rely on the internet for communication, and confidential data is often exchanged between networks. Remote accessibility also provides malicious parties with vulnerable targets for data interception. These may violate user privacy settings and compromise devices connected to the internet.

Network attacks occur in various forms. Enterprises need to ensure that they maintain the highest cybersecurity standards, network security policies, and staff training to safeguard their assets against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. 

### DDoS

DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks involve deploying sprawling networks of botnets — malware-compromised devices linked to the internet. These bombard and overwhelm enterprise servers with high volumes of fraudulent traffic. Malicious attackers may target time-sensitive data, such as that belonging to healthcare institutions, interrupting access to vital patient database records. 

### Man-in-the-middle Attacks

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) network attacks occur when malicious parties intercept traffic conveyed between networks and external data sources or within a network. In most cases, hackers achieve man-in-the-middle attacks via weak security protocols. These enable hackers to convey themselves as a relay or proxy account and manipulate data in real-time transactions. 


### Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can hold, causing data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities, as attackers can exploit buffer overflows to inject and execute malicious code.

### Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized access refers to network attacks where malicious parties gain access to enterprise assets without seeking permission. Such incidences may occur due to weak account password protection, unencrypted networks, insider threats that abuse role privileges, and the exploitation of inactive roles with administrator rights. 

Organizations should prioritize and maintain the least privilege principle to avoid the risks of privilege escalation and unauthorized access. 

### Packet sniffer

A passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer. By placing a passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter, that receiver can obtain a copy of every packet that is transmitted! These packets can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including passwords, social security numbers, trade secrets, and private personal messages. some of the best defenses against packet sniffing involve cryptography. 

### IP Spoofing 

The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user. To solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, a mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does.

### DNS spoofing

Also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver’s cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address.

### ARP Table

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables store the MAC-to-IP address mappings of devices that have recently communicated on a network. By analyzing the ARP cache, you can passively identify devices in a network without actively probing them.

**Why ARP Table is Passive?**

It does not send any network packets (unlike active scanning tools like Nmap).
It relies on previously stored network interactions.
It helps in discovering devices without triggering IDS/IPS alerts.

**Windows:**

```
arp -a
```

- Displays the ARP table containing IP-to-MAC address mappings stored by the system.

**Linux:**

```
arp -n
```

- Displays the ARP table without resolving hostnames

```
ip neigh show
```

- Displays ARP table with additional information like connection state. Modern ARP table lookup with connection states.
