**Information security (InfoSec)**: refers to the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, modification, destruction, or theft. 

The goal of information security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability whether it is stored, transmitted, or processed.

### Core Elements of Information Security:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or systems accessing the information.
- **Authorization**: Granting access rights to users based on their identity or roles.
- **Encryption**: Encoding information to prevent unauthorized access during transmission or storage.
- **Access Control**: Restricting who can view or modify information.
- **Incident Response**: Detecting, responding to, and recovering from security breaches or incidents.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating potential threats to information security.


InfoSec can exist in various forms:

 **1. Printed or Written Information**

- **Examples**: Documents, handwritten notes, printed reports, physical books, or forms.

**Security Measures**:

- Locked storage (filing cabinets, safes).
- Shredding sensitive documents before disposal.
- Access controls to physical files (e.g., restricted areas).
- Watermarks to prevent unauthorized copying.


 **2. Digital or Electronic Information**

- **Examples**: Files stored on computers, cloud storage, emails, databases, or media like USB drives.

**Security Measures**:

- Encryption (e.g., AES for stored files, TLS for data in transit).
- Secure authentication (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- Backup solutions for recovery.
- Firewalls and antivirus software.


**3. Spoken or Oral Information**

- **Examples**: Conversations, phone calls, meetings, or video conferences.

**Security Measures**:

- Avoiding sensitive discussions in public places.
- Using secure communication channels (e.g., encrypted VoIP or secure conferencing platforms).
- NDA agreements to prevent disclosure of confidential information.


**4. Visual Information**

- **Examples**: Whiteboard presentations, diagrams, photographs, or videos.

 **Security Measures**:
 
- Ensuring unauthorized individuals cannot view presentations.
- Encrypting or watermarking digital media.
- Restricting the use of cameras in sensitive areas.


**5. Stored Media**

- **Examples**: Information on physical devices like hard drives, USBs, CDs, or DVDs.

**Security Measures**:

- Encrypting data on removable media.
- Physical security for media storage.
- Secure destruction of obsolete media (e.g., shredding hard drives).


**6. Cloud-Based or Virtual Information**

- **Examples**: Data stored and accessed via the cloud.

 **Security Measures**:
 
- Strong access controls and encryption.
- Regular auditing and monitoring.
- Compliance with security standards like ISO 27001.

# Intellectual Property

**Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** are legal rights that protect the creations and ideas of people or businesses. 

These rights make sure that the creators or owners can control how their work is used and earn money from it, while preventing others from copying or using it without permission.

**Why is IPR Important?**

- It **rewards creativity** and innovation.
- It **encourages new ideas** by ensuring creators can benefit from their work.
- It **protects businesses** from unfair competition.

### Categories of Intellectual Property:

1. **Copyright**

- Protects: Original works of authorship such as literature, music, films, software, and artistic works.
- Duration: Typically the life of the author plus a specific number of years (e.g., 70 years in many jurisdictions).


2. **Trademark**

- Protects: Distinctive signs, symbols, logos, words, or phrases that distinguish goods or services of one entity from another.
- Duration: Can last indefinitely with proper renewal.


3. **Patent**

- Protects: Inventions and innovations that are novel, useful, and non-obvious.
- Duration: Usually 20 years from the filing date.


4. **Trade Secrets**

- Protects: Confidential business information such as formulas, practices, processes, designs, or methods that provide a competitive advantage.
- Duration: As long as the information remains confidential.

5. **Geographical Indications**

 #### 1. Confidentiality

**Confidentiality is about preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties.**

It also means trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data private and anonymous. 

Often confidentiality is compromised by cracking poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, disclosing sensitive data.

Standard measures to establish confidentiality include:

- Data encryption

- Two-factor authentication

- Biometric verification

- Security tokens

---
#### 2. Integrity 

**Integrity refers to protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties.** 

Standard measures to guarantee integrity include:
