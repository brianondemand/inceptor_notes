**Information security (InfoSec)**: refers to the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, modification, destruction, or theft. 

The goal of information security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability whether it is stored, transmitted, or processed.

Personal data is "_Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly_".
### Core Elements of Information Security:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or systems accessing the information.
- **Authorization**: Granting access rights to users based on their identity or roles.
- **Encryption**: Encoding information to prevent unauthorized access during transmission or storage.
- **Access Control**: Restricting who can view or modify information.
- **Incident Response**: Detecting, responding to, and recovering from security breaches or incidents.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating potential threats to information security.


InfoSec can exist in various forms:

 **1. Printed or Written Information**

- **Examples**: Documents, handwritten notes, printed reports, physical books, or forms.

**Security Measures**:

- Locked storage (filing cabinets, safes).
- Shredding sensitive documents before disposal.
- Access controls to physical files (e.g., restricted areas).
- Watermarks to prevent unauthorized copying.


 **2. Digital or Electronic Information**

- **Examples**: Files stored on computers, cloud storage, emails, databases, or media like USB drives.

**Security Measures**:

- Encryption (e.g., AES for stored files, TLS for data in transit).
- Secure authentication (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- Backup solutions for recovery.
- Firewalls and antivirus software.


**3. Spoken or Oral Information**

- **Examples**: Conversations, phone calls, meetings, or video conferences.

**Security Measures**:

- Avoiding sensitive discussions in public places.
- Using secure communication channels (e.g., encrypted VoIP or secure conferencing platforms).
- NDA agreements to prevent disclosure of confidential information.


**4. Visual Information**

- **Examples**: Whiteboard presentations, diagrams, photographs, or videos.

 **Security Measures**:
 
- Ensuring unauthorized individuals cannot view presentations.
- Encrypting or watermarking digital media.
- Restricting the use of cameras in sensitive areas.


**5. Stored Media**

- **Examples**: Information on physical devices like hard drives, USBs, CDs, or DVDs.

**Security Measures**:

- Encrypting data on removable media.
- Physical security for media storage.
- Secure destruction of obsolete media (e.g., shredding hard drives).


**6. Cloud-Based or Virtual Information**

- **Examples**: Data stored and accessed via the cloud.

 **Security Measures**:
 
- Strong access controls and encryption.
- Regular auditing and monitoring.
- Compliance with security standards like ISO 27001.

# Intellectual Property Rights

**Intellectual property (IP)** refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.

**Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** are legal rights that protect the creations and ideas of people or businesses. 

These rights make sure that the creators or owners can control how their work is used and earn money from it, while preventing others from copying or using it without permission.

**Why is IPR Important?**

- It **rewards creativity** and innovation.
- It **encourages new ideas** by ensuring creators can benefit from their work.
- It **protects businesses** from unfair competition.

### Types of intellectual property :

1. **Copyright**

- Copyright is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. 
- Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps and technical drawings.

- Protects Original works of authorship such as literature, music, films, software, and artistic works.


2. **Trademark**

- A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. 
- Trademarks date back to ancient times when artisans used to put their signature or "mark" on their products.

- Protects Distinctive signs, symbols, logos, words, or phrases that distinguish goods or services of one entity from another.


3. **Patent**

- A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. Generally speaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how - or whether - the invention can be used by others. 
- In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document.

- Protects Inventions and innovations that are novel, useful, and non-obvious.


4. **Trade Secrets**

- Trade secrets are IP rights on confidential information which may be sold or licensed. The unauthorized acquisition, use or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection.

- Protects Confidential business information such as formulas, practices, processes, designs, or methods that provide a competitive advantage.

5. **Geographical Indications**

- Geographical indications and appellations of origin are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, a reputation or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. 
- Most commonly, a geographical indication includes the name of the place of origin of the goods.

- Protects: Products originating from a specific location that possess qualities, reputation, or characteristics unique to that area (e.g., Champagne, Darjeeling tea).

6. **Industrial Designs**

- An industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. 
- A design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an article, or of two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color.

- Protects Aesthetic or ornamental aspects of a product (e.g., shape, patterns, or colors)
