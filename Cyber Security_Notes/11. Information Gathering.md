# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is gathering information about a target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 

This can involve various techniques such as analyzing publicly available information about the target, using tools to scan the target's network and systems for open ports and services, and trying to gather information about the target's employees and business practices.

The goal of reconnaissance is to gather as much information as possible about the target to create a detailed profile of the system or network and identify any potential weaknesses that can be exploited. This information can then be used to plan and execute a successful attack on the target.

### Types of Reconnaissance


#### Active Reconnaissance

Active reconnaissance involves interacting with the target system or network to gather information. 

This includes techniques such as running a port scan on the server to identify open ports and services, attempting to access restricted pages or resources within the application, or using tools to try and identify vulnerabilities within the application or underlying system.

#### Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance is gathering information from publicly available sources without actively interacting with the target system or network. 

This includes techniques such as analyzing the target application's website and social media presence, looking up information about the application's developers and users, and reviewing publicly available documents such as user manuals and support documentation.


**Advantages of Active Reconnaissance**

1. **Identify active systems and services**: Active reconnaissance allows you to identify which systems and services are actively running and responding to requests, rather than just those configured or present on the network.
2. **Comprehensive information gathering**: Active reconnaissance allows you to gather more information about a target system or network. You can interact with the system directly and probe it for information. This can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may not be detectable through passive reconnaissance methods.
3. **Gather real-time information**: Active reconnaissance allows you to gather information about a target system or network in real time, rather than relying on outdated or historical data. This can be useful for identifying current vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.

 **Disadvantages of Active Reconnaissance**

1. **Risk of detection**: Active reconnaissance involves actively interacting with the target system or network, which increases the risk of being detected by the target. This can trigger security alerts or defensive measures, disrupting the reconnaissance process.
2. **Risk of disruption**: Active reconnaissance can also disrupt the target system or network, disrupting the target's operations and potentially causing damage. This can be especially risky if the target is a critical infrastructure or has high-security requirements.
3. **Increased time and resources**: Active reconnaissance can be more time-consuming and resource-intensive than passive reconnaissance, as it involves actively interacting with the target and may require specialized tools and techniques.

**Advantages of Passive Reconnaissance**

1. **Lower risk of detection**: Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information from publicly available sources without actively interacting with the target system or network, which reduces the risk of being detected by the target. This can be especially useful in cases where the target has high-security requirements or is sensitive to disruptions.
2. **Lower risk of disruption**: Passive reconnaissance also involves a smaller risk of disrupting the target system or network, as it does not involve actively interacting with the target.
3. **Lower resource requirements**: Passive reconnaissance is generally less resource-intensive than active reconnaissance, as it does not require specialized tools or techniques and can often be done using readily available information.

 **Disadvantages of Passive Reconnaissance**

1. **Less accurate and comprehensive information**: Passive reconnaissance relies on publicly available information, which may need to be more detailed and precise than information gathered through active reconnaissance.
2. **Limited ability to identify vulnerabilities**: Passive reconnaissance does not involve actively interacting with the target, which limits the ability to use tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Limited control over reconnaissance process**: With passive reconnaissance, the security team is limited to the information that is publicly available and has less control over the process than with active reconnaissance.

# Extracting Domain Registration Information 


### `whois`

The `whois` tool in **Kali Linux** is a command-line utility used to query domain registration and ownership information from **WHOIS databases**. It helps gather details about a domain name, such as the registrar, registrant contact details, creation and expiration dates, name servers, and more.

The Whois database contains details such as the registration date of the domain name, when it expires, ownership and contact information, nameserver information of the domain, the registrar via which the domain was purchased, etc.

###  How to Use the `whois` 

 **Basic WHOIS Query**

```
whois google.com
```


🔹 Retrieves registration details for `google.com`.

---

**WHOIS Query for an IP Address**

```
whois 8.8.8.8
```

whois -h whois.arin.net 8.8.8.8
```

🔹 Queries the **ARIN WHOIS server** for the IP address details.

---

**Checking Domain WHOIS with a Specific TLD Registry**

```
whois -h whois.verisign-grs.com google.com
```

🔹 Queries **Verisign's WHOIS server** (used for `.com` and `.net` domains).

---

Some Registrars offer privacy protection services that allow their customers to mask their actual contact details in the Whois search result in order to prevent their private contact information falling into the hands of spammers and scammers. Get in touch with your Registrar to learn more about your options.

# Ports and Services Enumeration on Webservers

### `Nmap`

Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux command-line tool that is used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network and to detect installed applications.

Nmap is the most famous scanning tool used by penetration testers.

Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services, and detect vulnerabilities.

Other features of Nmap include:

- Ability to quickly recognize all the devices including servers, routers, switches, mobile devices, etc on single or multiple networks.

- Helps identify services running on a system including web servers, DNS servers, and other common applications. Nmap can also detect application versions with reasonable accuracy to help detect existing vulnerabilities.

- Nmap can find information about the operating system running on devices. It can provide detailed information like OS versions, making it easier to plan additional approaches during penetration testing.

- During security auditing and vulnerability scanning, you can use Nmap to attack systems using existing scripts from the Nmap Scripting Engine.

- Nmap has a graphical user interface called Zenmap. It helps you develop visual mappings of a network for better usability and reporting.


##### Ping scan

```bash
nmap -sp 192.168.1.1/24
```

Scans the list of devices up and running on a given subnet.

---

##### Scan a single host

```bash
nmap scanme.nmap.org
```

Scans a single host for 1000 well-known ports. These ports are the ones used by popular services like SQL, SNTP, apache, and others.

---

##### Stealth Scan

Stealth scanning is performed by sending an SYN packet and analyzing the response. If SYN/ACK is received, it means the port is open, and you can open a TCP connection.

However, a stealth scan never completes the 3-way handshake, which makes it hard for the target to determine the scanning system.

```bash
nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org
```

You can use the `-sS` command to perform a stealth scan. Remember, stealth scanning is slower and not as aggressive as the other types of scanning, so you might have to wait a while to get a response

---

#### Version scanning

Finding application versions is a crucial part in penetration testing.

It makes your life easier since you can find an existing vulnerability from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVE) database (`ExploitDB`) for a particular version of the service. You can then use it to attack a machine using an exploitation tool like Metasploit.

```bash
 nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org
```

To do a version scan, use the `-sV` command. Nmap will provide a list of services with its versions. Do keep in mind that version scans are not always 100% accurate, but it does take you one step closer to successfully getting into a system.

---

#### OS Scanning

In addition to the services and their versions, Nmap can provide information about the underlying operating system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. Nmap will also try to find the system uptime during an OS scan.

```bash
 nmap -O scanme.nmap.org
```

You can use the additional flags like osscan-limit to limit the search to a few expected targets. Nmap will display the confidence percentage for each OS guess.

Again, OS detection is not always accurate, but it goes a long way towards helping a pen tester get closer to their target.

---

#### Aggressive Scanning

Nmap has an aggressive mode that enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. You can use the -A argument to perform an aggressive scan.

```bash
 nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
```

Aggressive scans provide far better information than regular scans. However, an aggressive scan also sends out more probes, and it is more likely to be detected during security audits.

---
#### Scanning Multiple Hosts

Nmap has the capability of scanning multiple hosts simultaneously. This feature comes in real handy when you are managing vast network infrastructure.

You can scan multiple hosts through numerous approaches:

- Write all the IP addresses in a single row to scan all of the hosts at the same time.

```bash
 nmap 192.164.1.1 192.164.0.2 192.164.0.2
```

- Use the asterisk `(*)` to scan all of the subnets at once.

```bash
 nmap 192.164.1.*
```

- Add commas to separate the addresses endings instead of typing the entire domains.

```bash
 nmap 192.164.0.1,2,3,4
```

- Use a hyphen to specify a range of IP addresses

```bash
 nmap 192.164.0.0–255
```

---

#### Port Scanning

Port scanning is one of the most fundamental features of Nmap. You can scan for ports in several ways.

- Using the `-p` param to scan for a single port

```bash
 nmap -p 973 192.164.0.1
```

- If you specify the type of port, you can scan for information about a particular type of connection, for example for a TCP connection.

```bash
 nmap -p T:7777, 973 192.164.0.1
```

- A range of ports can be scanned by separating them with a hyphen.

```bash
 nmap -p 76–973 192.164.0.1
```

- You can also use the **-top-ports** flag to specify the top n ports to scan.

```bash
 nmap --top-ports 10 scanme.nmap.org
```

---

#### Scanning from a File

If you want to scan a large list of IP addresses, you can do it by importing a file with the list of IP addresses.

```bash
 nmap -iL /scan_ips.txt
```

The above command will produce the scan results of all the given domains in the `“scan_ips.txt”` file. Other than simply scanning the IP addresses, you can use additional options and flags as well.

---

#### Verbosity and Exporting Scan Results

Penetration testing can last days or even weeks. Exporting Nmap results can be useful to avoid redundant work and to help with creating final reports.

##### Verbose Output

```bash
nmap -v scanme.nmap.org
```

The verbose output provides additional information about the scan being performed. It is useful to monitor step by step actions Nmap performs on a network, especially if you are an outsider scanning a client’s network.

##### Normal output

Nmap scans can also be exported to a text file. It will be slightly different from the original command line output, but it will capture all the essential scan results.

```bash
 nmap -oN output.txt scanme.nmap.org
```

##### XML output

Nmap scans can also be exported to XML. It is also the preferred file format of most pen-testing tools, making it easily organised when importing scan results.

```bash
 nmap -oX output.xml scanme.nmap.org
```

##### Multiple Formats

You can also export the scan results in all the available formats at once using the `-oA` command.

```bash
 nmap -oA output scanme.nmap.org
```

The above command will export the scan result in three files — output.xml, output. Nmap and `output.gnmap`.

---

## Nmap Scripting Engine

Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful tool that you can use to write scripts and automate numerous networking features.

You can find plenty of scripts distributed across Nmap, or write your own script based on your requirements. You can even modify existing scripts using the **Lua programming language**.

NSE also has attack scripts that are used in attacking the network and various networking protocols.


**Detecting Vulnerabilities** (`vuln` category)

```bash
nmap --script=vuln <target>
```

- Runs various vulnerability detection scripts against the target.

---

**Finding Open Ports and Services** (`default` category)

```bash
nmap -sC <target>
```

- Runs default scripts to detect open ports, services, and additional information.

---

**Checking for SMB Vulnerabilities** (`smb-vuln*`)

```bash
nmap --script=smb-vuln* <target>
```

- Checks for vulnerabilities like `EternalBlue (MS17-010)` on SMB services.

---

**Enumerating HTTP Information** (`http-enum`)

```bash
nmap --script=http-enum <target>
```

- Enumerates directories, files, and potential vulnerabilities on a web server.

---

**Brute-forcing Login Credentials** (`brute` category)

```bash
nmap --script=ssh-brute -p 22 <target>
```

- Attempts to brute-force SSH credentials (replace `ssh-brute` with `ftp-brute`, `http-brute`, etc., for other services).

---

## `Zenmap`

Zenmap is a graphical user interface for Nmap. It is a free and open-source software that helps you get up and running with Nmap.
