Legal documents and report writing play a crucial role in cybersecurity. These documents ensure compliance with laws, protect businesses from legal risks, and provide a structured approach to cybersecurity operations. Understanding different types of legal documents and how to write cybersecurity reports is essential for professionals in the field.

## Common Legal Documents in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity professionals must handle various legal documents that define responsibilities, establish security practices, and provide guidelines for handling cybersecurity incidents. These documents can be categorized based on different phases of cybersecurity engagements.

### 1. Sales Phase

Before entering into a cybersecurity engagement, agreements and contracts must be in place to outline the terms of service, scope of work, and legal liabilities. Common legal documents include:

- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):** Ensures confidentiality between parties before sharing sensitive information. Example: Before hiring a cybersecurity consultant, companies often sign an NDA to protect trade secrets.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Defines the level of service expected from cybersecurity vendors. Example: A managed security service provider (MSSP) may guarantee 99.9% uptime for security monitoring services.
- **Master Services Agreement (MSA):** Outlines the general terms and conditions between a cybersecurity service provider and a client. Example: An MSA between a security firm and a corporation may specify payment terms and dispute resolution processes.
- **Statement of Work (SOW):** Provides detailed descriptions of the cybersecurity services to be delivered. Example: A penetration testing engagement may have an SOW specifying test scope, methodology, and reporting format.

### 2. Before You Test

Before conducting penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, or security audits, it is necessary to have legal documents in place to protect both the security professionals and the organization being tested. Key documents include:

- **Rules of Engagement (ROE):** Specifies the scope, limitations, and methodologies for ethical hacking or penetration testing. Example: An ROE might limit tests to external networks only, excluding internal systems.
- **Authorization Letter:** Grants explicit permission for security testing to avoid legal issues related to unauthorized access. Example: A company CEO signs an authorization letter permitting an ethical hacker to test the company’s servers.
- **Indemnification Agreement:** Protects security testers from liability for unintended consequences arising from the tests. Example: If a penetration test accidentally causes system downtime, the indemnification agreement limits the tester's liability.

### 3. After You Test

Once a cybersecurity assessment is completed, documentation is required to communicate findings, suggest remediation strategies, and ensure accountability. Important legal documents include:

- **Penetration Testing Report:** Provides a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and risk assessments. Example: A penetration test report may identify SQL injection flaws in an e-commerce website and recommend patching the affected database.
- **Compliance Report:** Demonstrates adherence to industry regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001. Example: A healthcare organization submits a HIPAA compliance report to prove it secures patient data appropriately.
- **Incident Response Report:** Documents security incidents, their impact, and remediation measures taken. Example: If a company suffers a ransomware attack, an incident response report will document how the breach occurred and steps taken to recover data.
- **Security Audit Report:** Summarizes findings from security assessments and provides recommendations for improvements. Example: A financial institution’s annual security audit report may highlight areas for enhancing fraud detection mechanisms.

## Cybersecurity Report Writing

A cybersecurity report presents critical information about cybersecurity threats, risks within a digital ecosystem, gaps in security controls, and the performance of security programs.

Cybersecurity reports help to foster data-driven communication between boards, executives, security and risks leaders, and security practitioners to ensure that all parties are working together to enhance security programs and mitigate risk.

### Key Components of a Cybersecurity Report:

1. **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the report’s purpose, key findings, and recommendations.
2. **Scope and Objectives:** Defines the purpose of the report, what was tested, and the methodology used.
3. **Findings and Analysis:** Provides details on vulnerabilities, threats, and security weaknesses identified.
4. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluates the potential impact of discovered security issues.
5. **Recommendations and Remediation:** Offers actionable steps to mitigate risks and enhance security.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarizes key insights and final thoughts.
7. **Appendices:** Includes supplementary information such as logs, technical data, or references.


## Executive Summary Content

The executive summary of your cybersecurity report is just that - a summary! Don’t bloat it with technical explanations; that’s what the body of the report is for and even then, you should keep your technical ramblings restrained.

The executive summary should succinctly summarize your security program efforts and address all of the high-level security concerns of the leadership team.

To tick all of these boxes, your executive summary should be comprised of the following headings:

- Key findings
- Security Risk Monitoring Summary
- Cyber Incident Summary
- Cyber Threat Summary
- Remediation Recommendations


### Key Findings

The key findings section is a high-level summary of the major cybersecurity threats encountered in the current reporting period. It should also summarize the remediation efforts that addressed these risks and their efficacy.

Some examples of security incidents worthy of inclusion in this section are:

- **Phishing Attacks** - Especially the campaigns involving hackers posing as C-suite executives.
  
- **Critical Vulnerabilities** - Including **zero-day exploits**, such as **Log4Shell** and Spring4Shell.
  
- **Malware Injections** - Including failed ransomware attacks and other cyber attacks attempts.
  
- **Access Control Abuse** - Such as privilege escalation attempts.
  
- **Data Breaches -** The specific attack vectors that facilitated each security breach attempt.
  
- **Physical Security Threats** - Including lost hard-drives.
  
- **Critical Service Provider Vulnerabilities** - Software misconfigurations and data leaks in the third-party ecosystem, whether linked to poor security practices or insufficient security controls.

Some threat mitigation details worthy of mentioning include:

- Incident Response Plan protocols that were activated for each listed cyber risk.
  
- Methodologies used to measure risk impact.
  
- The lifecycle of each security event.
  
- The impact on computer systems and information systems.
  
- Penetration tests that were performed to confirm security control efficacy.
  
- Security awareness training programs that were implemented to prevent repeated incidents.
  
- Firewall settings that were reconfigured to prevent similar network breaches in the future.
  
- Overall improvements to your cybersecurity program that were implemented to increase threat resilience.


### Security Risk Monitoring Summary

Summarize the range of security risks and cyber threats monitored in the current reporting cycle. It’s just as important to mention which regions of the IT ecosystem were not monitored and why.

Also, describe the risk monitoring methodology used, i.e., real-time attack surface monitoring and any other attack surface monitoring processes.

Security rating software is the most popular method of monitoring emerging security risks and security posture deviations. If your information security team uses such a tool, be sure to summarize the specific data security attack vectors influencing your security rating calculation.

### Cyber Incident Summary

The security-related incident section is a more detailed delineation of the major remediation efforts mentioned under key findings. Focus on the most critical security incidents - those of the potentially greatest detriment to your security posture.

Such events in the third-party threat landscape are easier to track and identify if you’re implementing a vendor tiering strategy.

Demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement by benchmarking your risk management efforts against security policies and key metrics such as Mean Time to Contain (MTTC), Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR), etc. 

Also, mention any specific security controls that prevented cyber incidents, such as multi-factor authentication or specific cybersecurity framework controls, such as The NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

Because this section of the report offers a deeper explanation of encountered cyber incidents, there’s a risk of getting a little too technical with your wording. But don’t obsess over keeping to a set baseline of simplicity. You have a technical representative on the executive team who can offer further clarification.


### Cyber Threat Summary

The preceding section focused on the cyber incidents impacting your security posture, including those initiated by cybercriminals. This section should focus on emerging threats in your ecosystem, internally and throughout the third-party network. Cyber threats also include non-compliance with critical security regulations such as:

i. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

ii. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)


Describe the mechanisms used to discover these threats.

Cyber threat summaries could require mentions of complex cyber concepts. For board reports, these concepts should be communicated in a way that ensures clarity without leaving out vital information.

### Remediation Recommendations

This final section should summarize the necessary remediation processes for addressing the emerging risks mentioned in the preceding section. If these remediation initiatives require additional investment, include their approximate costs.
