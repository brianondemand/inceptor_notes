## The Internet

The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. (Network Of Networks)

Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.

It's important to realize that the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.

The **World Wide Web**—usually called the Web for short—is a collection of different websites you can access through the Internet. 

A **website** is made up of related text, images, and other resources.

Once you are connected to the Internet, you can access and view websites using a type of application called a web browser.

When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to your computer.

### Origin Of The Internet

The internet originated in the late 1960s with ARPANET, a U.S. Defense project designed to enable reliable communication through decentralized, packet-switched networks. Its development laid the groundwork for modern internet protocols, leading to public access in the 1990s.

### How do computers communicate

**Internet protocols (IP)** are a set of rules that allow computers and other devices to communicate over the Internet. These protocols ensure that data is sent, received, and understood correctly between different systems. 

**IP Routing** : Process of forwarding IP packets from source to destination.

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device or domain that connects to the Internet. Each IP address is a series of characters, such as '192.168.1.1'.

We have two types of IP addresses: IPv4 &. IPv6

IP packets are created by adding an IP header to each packet of data before it is sent on its way. An IP header is just a series of bits (ones and zeros), and it records several pieces of information about the packet, including the sending and receiving IP address. IP headers also report:

- Header length

- Packet length

- **Time to live (TTL)**, or the number of network hops a packet can make before it is discarded

- Which transport protocol is being used (TCP, UDP, etc.)

### DNS

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is the phonebook of the Internet.

DNS lets users connect to websites using domain names instead of IP addresses.

Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.


### There are 4 DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:

1. **The DNS recursor** is a server designed to receive queries from client machines through applications such as web browsers.

2. **The Root Server** is the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses.

3. **The Top Level Domain Server (TLD)**  is the next step in the search for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is “com”).


4. **The Authoritative Nameserver** is the last stop in the nameserver query. If the authoritative name server has access to the requested record, it will return the IP address for the requested hostname back to the DNS Recursor that made the initial request.


#### What's the difference between a DNS server and a recursive DNS resolver?

A **DNS server** is a general term for any server that stores and responds to DNS queries by providing information like IP addresses for domain names. It includes authoritative DNS servers, which have definitive information about specific domains.

A **recursive DNS resolver**, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary that queries multiple DNS servers on behalf of a client to resolve a domain name into an IP address. It starts with the root DNS servers and works its way down to find the answer, caching results to speed up future queries.

In short, the **purpose** of a DNS server is to store or provide specific DNS data, while the **purpose** of a recursive resolver is to retrieve that data on behalf of the user.


## Reference Models

Network reference models provide standardized frameworks for understanding and designing communication systems.

The OSI model has seven layers, from the physical layer (handling hardware transmission) to the application layer (enabling user interaction).

The TCP/IP model, more practical and widely used, has four layers: network interface, internet, transport, and application.

By organizing functions into layers, these models ensure interoperability, simplify troubleshooting, and facilitate the development of protocols and technologies.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) 

It is a network protocol used to determine the MAC address (hardware address) from any IP address.

So, the goal is to find out the MAC address of where we want to talk to. That’s where ARP comes in handy. It helps by turning the IP address into the physical MAC address, so we can chat with other devices on the network.


#### How Does It Work?

When a new computer joins a local area network (LAN), it will receive a unique IP address to use for identification and communication. 

Packets of data arrive at a gateway, destined for a particular host machine. 

The gateway, or the piece of hardware on a network that allows data to flow from one network to another, asks the ARP program to find a **MAC address** that matches the IP address. 

The **ARP cache** keeps a list of each IP address and its matching MAC address. 

The ARP cache is dynamic, but users on a network can also configure a static ARP table containing IP addresses and MAC addresses.

## Types Of ARP

 **Proxy ARP**

Proxy ARP is a technique by which a proxy device on a given network answers the ARP request for an IP address that is not on that network. The proxy is aware of the location of the traffic's destination and offers its own MAC address as the destination. 

 **Gratuitous ARP**

Gratuitous ARP is almost like an administrative procedure, carried out as a way for a host on a network to simply announce or update its IP-to-MAC address. Gratuitous ARP is not prompted by an ARP request to translate an IP address to a MAC address.

**Reverse ARP (RARP)**

Host machines that do not know their own IP address can use the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) for discovery.

**Inverse ARP (IARP)**

Whereas ARP uses an IP address to find a MAC address, IARP uses a MAC address to find an IP address.

## ARP Attacks


**ARP spoofing**

ARP spoofing is also known as ARP poison routing or ARP cache poisoning. This is a type of malicious attack in which a cyber criminal sends fake ARP messages to a target LAN with the intention of linking their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device or server within the network. The link allows for data from the victim's computer to be sent to the attacker's computer instead of the original destination.


**Man-in-the-Middle (MTM) Attacks**

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type of eavesdropping in which the cyberattacker intercepts, relays, and alters messages between two parties—who have no idea that a third party is involved—to steal information.

**Denial-of-Service Attacks**

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is one in which a cyberattacker attempts to overwhelm systems, servers, and networks with traffic to prevent users from accessing them. A larger-scale DoS attack is known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, where a much larger number of sources are used to flood a system with traffic.
