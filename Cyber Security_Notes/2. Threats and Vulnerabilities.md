## **2. Types of Threats**

### **2.1 Malware (Malicious Software)**

- Software intentionally designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

| **Malware Type** | **Definition**                                                                                      | **Characteristics**                                                                                                 | **Method of Spread**             | **Key Impact**                               | **Examples**               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Viruses**       | Malicious software that attaches itself to files or programs and spreads when executed.           | - Self-replicating<br>- Requires human action to spread                                                             | Attaches to files/programs       | Data corruption, system slowdown             | ILOVEYOU, Melissa          |
| **Worms**         | Standalone malware that replicates itself and spreads across networks.                           | - Does not need a host<br>- Exploits network vulnerabilities<br>- Can spread without user intervention               | Exploits network vulnerabilities | Network disruption, backdoors                | Morris, Conficker          |
| **Trojans**       | Malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.                      | - Deceptive appearance<br>- Does not self-replicate<br>- Acts as a gateway for other malware                         | Disguised as legitimate apps     | Data theft, remote access for attackers      | Zeus, Emotet               |
| **Ransomware**    | Malware that encrypts files or locks systems, demanding payment to restore access.               | - Highly disruptive<br>- Often spread via phishing emails<br>- Increasingly uses "ransomware-as-a-service" models   | Phishing emails, exploits        | File encryption, ransom demand               | WannaCry, LockBit          |
| **Spyware**       | Malware designed to secretly monitor and collect user data.                                      | - Operates stealthily<br>- Collects sensitive information<br>- Often bundled with legitimate software                | Bundled software, websites       | Data theft, privacy invasion                 | Keyloggers, Pegasus        |


- **Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Use antivirus and anti-malware tools.  
  - Regularly update software.  
  - Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources.  

### **2.2 Phishing**

- Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.  
- **Types of Phishing**:  
  - **Email Phishing**: Fake emails with malicious links or attachments.  
  - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.  
  - **Smishing and Vishing**: Use of SMS or voice calls for phishing.  
  - **Whaling**: Targeting high-profile individuals (e.g., executives).  

- **Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Verify the source of emails and messages.  
  - Avoid clicking on suspicious links.  
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

### **2.3 DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks**

- Overloading a system with excessive traffic to render it unavailable to users.  
- **Difference**:  
  - DoS originates from a single source.  
  - DDoS originates from multiple sources (e.g., botnets).  

- **Impact**:  
  - Service outages.  
  - Revenue losses for businesses.  
  - Reputational damage.  

- **Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  
  - Use content delivery networks (CDNs).  
  - Monitor traffic patterns for anomalies.
