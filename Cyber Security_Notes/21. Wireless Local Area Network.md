**WLAN** stands for **Wireless Local Area Network**. WLAN is a local area network that uses radio communication to provide mobility to the network users while maintaining the connectivity to the wired network. 

A WLAN basically, extends a wired local area network. WLAN’s are built by attaching a device called the access point(AP) to the edge of the wired network. Clients communicate with the AP using a wireless network adapter which is similar in function to an ethernet adapter. It is also called a LAWN is a Local area wireless network. 

## The Evolution of Wi-Fi Technology and Standards


**The Evolution of Wi-Fi Technology and Standards**

Wi-Fi technology has evolved significantly since its inception, transforming the way people connect to the internet and communicate wirelessly. From the early days of slow and unreliable connections to today's high-speed, low-latency networks, Wi-Fi has become an essential component of modern life. This document explores the history, development, and future trends of Wi-Fi technology and standards.

### 1. The Beginnings of Wi-Fi (1990s)

Wi-Fi technology traces its roots back to the 1990s, when the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) introduced the **802.11 standard** in 1997. The initial 802.11 standard supported speeds of only **2 Mbps**, which was significantly slower than wired connections at the time. Despite its limitations, it paved the way for wireless networking.

### 2. The Advancement of Wi-Fi Standards

Over the years, multiple iterations of the 802.11 standard have been developed to improve speed, reliability, and efficiency. Below is a timeline of key Wi-Fi advancements:

- **1999 - 802.11a and 802.11b:**
    
    - 802.11a operated in the **5 GHz** band and supported speeds up to **54 Mbps**.
    - 802.11b operated in the **2.4 GHz** band and reached speeds up to **11 Mbps**, making it more widely adopted.
      
- **2003 - 802.11g:**
    
    - Combined the best of 802.11a and 802.11b, operating in the **2.4 GHz** band with speeds up to **54 Mbps**.
      
- **2009 - 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4):**
    
    - Introduced **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)** technology.
    - Operated on both **2.4 GHz and 5 GHz** bands.
    - Offered speeds up to **600 Mbps**.
      
- **2013 - 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5):**
    
    - Improved MIMO with **MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO)**.
    - Operated exclusively on **5 GHz**, supporting speeds up to **3.5 Gbps**.
      
- **2019 - 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6):**
    
    - Introduced **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)** for better efficiency.
    - Improved battery efficiency with **Target Wake Time (TWT)**.
    - Increased speed up to **9.6 Gbps**.
      
- **2021 - Wi-Fi 6E:**
    
    - Expanded into the **6 GHz** band for reduced congestion.
      
- **2024 (Expected) - Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be):**
    
    - Promises speeds exceeding **30 Gbps**.
    - Utilizes **320 MHz channels** and improved MU-MIMO.

## Hacking Wireless Networks

**Access Point:** The point where the mobile device, computers connect to the wireless network.

**SSID:** Service Set Identifier identifies the access point, it is a human-readable text which when broadcasted leads to the identification of an access point. 

**BSSID**: Mac address of the Access point.

**Bandwidth**: Amount of information that can be transferred over the connection.

There are various standards for wireless transmission:

## Authentication:

#### Open Authentication:

When a client wants to connect to an open access point he/she sends a probe request, and the AP sends a probe response; the client then sends an authentication request. Upon receiving a response, the client establishes an association with the AP.

#### Shared Key Authentication Process:

Here, the client sends a probe request, and the access point sends the probe response; then, the client requests for an authentication request, the AP sends an authentication challenge to the client. The client needs to send the shared key as authentication challenge response. AP, then, verifies the client and authenticates him/her, who then establishes a connection with the access point.

#### Centralised Authentication:

In the corporate environment, instead of an Access point verifying client’s authentication details, a centralised server does the job of verifying the client. RADIUS is a centralised authentication server which verifies clients who want to connect with the access point.
