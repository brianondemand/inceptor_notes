`hping3` is a **command-line network security tool** used for **scanning, testing, and troubleshooting** networks. It allows users to **craft and send custom TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw IP packets**, making it useful for **firewall testing, port scanning, intrusion detection system (IDS) testing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attack simulations**.

It is similar to the standard `ping` command but **far more powerful**, as it enables advanced packet manipulation and supports various protocols beyond just ICMP.


**Port Scanning** – Checks which ports are open on a target system.   
**Firewall Testing** – Detects firewall rules and security configurations.  
**IP Spoofing** – Sends packets with a fake source IP address.  
**DoS Attack Simulation** – Generates high-traffic floods to test system resilience.   
**Traceroute Functionality** – Maps the network path of packets using TCP instead of ICMP.  
**Packet Crafting** – Allows full customization of network packets (flags, payloads, timing, etc.).


`hping` sends **custom network packets** to a target and analyzes the response. Based on the type of response (or lack thereof), it can infer information about:

- **Open/closed ports**
- **Firewall rules**
- **Network latency**
- **System uptime**
- **Routing paths**

Unlike `ping`, which only sends ICMP Echo Requests, `hping` can send packets using **TCP, UDP, ICMP, or raw IP**, making it useful for both **legitimate security testing and malicious attacks** (ethical hacking, penetration testing).

---

 **1. Check if a host is online (like ping but with more control)**

```bash
hping3 -1 192.168.1.1
```

- `-1`: Sends **ICMP Echo Requests** (like `ping`).

 **2. Perform a TCP SYN Scan (detect open ports)**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `-S`: Sends **SYN packets** to test if a port is open.
- `-p 80`: Target **port 80** (HTTP).

**3. Detect firewalls (Send ACK packets)**

```bash
hping3 -A -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `-A`: Sends **ACK packets** (firewalls usually block these if no prior connection exists).

 **4. Spoof Source IP Address (IP Spoofing)**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 443 -a 10.10.10.10 192.168.1.1
```

- `-a 10.10.10.10`: Fake source IP **(spoofing attack simulation)**.

 **5. Simulate a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**

```bash
hping3 -S --flood -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `--flood`: Sends packets **as fast as possible** (network stress testing).

 **6. Perform a TCP Traceroute**

```bash
hping3 --traceroute -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `--traceroute`: Maps **network path** using **TCP instead of ICMP**.
