**Network sniffing** is the process of **capturing and analyzing network traffic** to monitor communications, troubleshoot network issues, or intercept sensitive data. Sniffers can be used for **legitimate purposes** like network diagnostics and performance monitoring, but they can also be exploited by **attackers to steal credentials, eavesdrop on conversations, or inject malicious packets**.

Sniffing works by capturing **packets traveling through a network**. Depending on the method used, it can be:

1. **Passive Sniffing** – Monitoring network traffic **without interfering** with data flow (used in unencrypted networks or when connected to a hub).
2. **Active Sniffing** – Actively manipulating network traffic (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing) to intercept data even on switched networks.


Placing a device on the network that plugs into a SPAN port of a layer2/layer3 switch can accomplish network sniffing in either passive sniffing or active mode. An application loaded on a virtual machine spanning several virtual network interfaces could also do sniffing.

Network engineers, security operations networks, and application security teams commonly use network sniffer tools. These tools collect all traffic across specific subnets or traffic sent to a SPAN port. Network sniffers are a valuable tool for detecting rogue devices, including Wi-Fi access points, printers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices recently introduced into the network.

There are three standard sniffing techniques by hackers and internal networking teams:

**1. MAC Spoofing**

Hackers and internal teams wanting to collect MAC addresses across all segments will execute this form of sniffing. Internal teams will take this information and create access control lists (ACLs), allowing only these MAC addresses to resonate on the networks. Hackers love to gain access to their targets’ MAC addresses to establish a rogue presence by spoofing an approved MAC.

**2. MAC Flooding**

MAC flooding is a common hacker technique designed to overwhelm the local network segments by sending unique MAC addresses attempting to dominate the network infrastructure.

**3. DNS Cache Poisoning/Evil Twin**

Hackers will attack your organization’s DNS by altering the various records and redirecting network traffic. Hackers call this redirection an “evil twin.”


## Standard Tools for Network Sniffing

Network and security teams have a wide variety of sniffing tools available. Cybersecurity solution manufacturers sell many of these tools. While others are available through the open-source community. Here is a short list of tools:

**Wireshark**

Wireshark is one of the most used sniffer tools. The tool helps capture valuable network telemetry information between sources and designations within the network. The hacker community also commonly uses this open source.

The tool has a very easy-to-use UI filled with pre-configured filtering to help engineers troubleshoot faster.

**tcpdump**

tcpdump is a computer program that analyzes data network packets and operates through a command-line interface. This tool allows the user to monitor TCP/IP and other packets being sent or received over the network to which the computer is connected. Tcpdump is free software available under the BSD license.



### How to Detect Network Sniffing?

Detecting network sniffing is challenging for most network and security teams. Organizations with substantial investments in Wireshare, or tcpdump face even more significant challenges in discovering and blocking rogue sniffing technology.

The first key indicator would be excessive network traffic directed to a specific host. This sudden increase in network utilization could be the first step in detecting a new or rogue entity on the network.

Organizations concerned about this increase in traffic should invest in tools like Anti-Sniff, Sniff Detection, or Snort.

### Preventing Network Sniffing

Network and security teams have several options to prevent rogue network sniffing. As more organizations extend their networks and applications into hybrid cloud and third-party hosted portals, detecting and preventing their traffic from being exposed and deploying these countermeasures must become a top priority.

**Use Encryption**

Organizations in the EU and other parts of the world already have an encryption presence. Healthcare information, personal information within the EU, or similar data within California require encryption. Ensuring all data is at rest and in transit, even within the internal network, stays encrypted helps prevent rogue sniffers from reading your data.

**Implement Network Segmentation**

Network segmentation continues to gain traction within organizations. It prevents ransomware attacks from spreading laterally within their target’s network. Attacks stop when they attempt to communicate with non-standard or unapproved ports.

This same network security capability also helps stop rogue sniffing behavior. Defining network segments allowing traffic sent from many ports into one can help. Preventing one-to-many copying is ideal for stopping a rogue sniffer from functioning. Network and security teams, through network segment policies, can designate only specific ports and hosts that can communicate in one-to-many capacities.

**Regular Network Audits**

Another valuable workstream organization should execute a regular network audit to validate only specific MAC addresses and IP addresses and communicate between the various segments. Hackers will attempt to alter their victim’s network, connect using a spoofed MAC or IP address, or try to load malware on an internal host. These security breach attempts should warrant an organization to hire third-party penetration testing to validate that the network security controls, including ACLs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, are functional, updated, and effective in stopping rogue sniffing activities.

**Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on SNORT signatures became replaced with more advanced NDR powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). NDR capabilities live within the network to help spot changes in behavior, access, and bandwidth consumption. AI plays a critical role in preventing rogue sniffing. Hackers will rapidly alter their methods to embed their sniffer inside their target’s network and cloud segments. Using AI, hackers often deploy decoy sniffers within their target’s network, attempting to overwhelm the internal SecOps teams.

### Common Tools for Network Sniffing

**1. Wireshark**

- A **powerful open-source packet analyzer** used for **network monitoring, protocol analysis, and security testing**.
- Captures and **decodes network traffic** in real-time.
- Can **filter packets** to analyze specific protocols like HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.


**2. tcpdump** (Command-Line Packet Sniffer)

- A **lightweight CLI tool** for **capturing and analyzing packets** on Unix/Linux.
- Useful for **real-time monitoring** and **automated network analysis**.
