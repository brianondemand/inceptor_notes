# Vulnerability vs Threat vs Risk

## Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness, flaw, or other shortcoming in a system that could be exploited.

There are different types of vulnerabilities; we can sum them up generally as:

- **Technical vulnerabilities**, like bugs in code or an error in some hardware or software.

- **Human vulnerabilities**, such as employees falling for phishing, smishing or other common attacks.

#### Impact of vulnerability

The impact type of vulnerability describes the type of harm an attack could cause if the vulnerability were exploited.

There are three types of impact:   
  
**1. Elevation of privilege**   
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could assume greater privileges on a compromised system, allowing them to potentially destroy data or take control of computers for malicious purposes.   
  
**2. Information disclosure**  
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could obtain access to confidential information.  
  
**3. Denial of service**   
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could prevent authorized access to computing resources or interfere with a system’s operations.

## Threat

A threat is  anything that could exploit a vulnerability, which could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your systems, data, people, and more.

### Types of Threats

#### 1. Malware (Malicious Software)

Software intentionally designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

| **Malware Type** | **Definition**                                                                                      | **Characteristics**                                                                                                 | **Method of Spread**             | **Key Impact**                               | **Examples**               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Viruses**       | Malicious software that attaches itself to files or programs and spreads when executed.           | - Self-replicating<br>- Requires human action to spread                                                             | Attaches to files/programs       | Data corruption, system slowdown             | ILOVEYOU, Melissa          |
| **Worms**         | Standalone malware that replicates itself and spreads across networks.                           | - Does not need a host<br>- Exploits network vulnerabilities<br>- Can spread without user intervention               | Exploits network vulnerabilities | Network disruption, backdoors                | Morris, Conficker          |
| **Trojans**       | Malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.                      | - Deceptive appearance<br>- Does not self-replicate<br>- Acts as a gateway for other malware                         | Disguised as legitimate apps     | Data theft, remote access for attackers      | Zeus, Emotet               |
| **Ransomware**    | Malware that encrypts files or locks systems, demanding payment to restore access.               | - Highly disruptive<br>- Often spread via phishing emails<br>- Increasingly uses "ransomware-as-a-service" models   | Phishing emails, exploits        | File encryption, ransom demand               | WannaCry, LockBit          |
| **Spyware**       | Malware designed to secretly monitor and collect user data.                                      | - Operates stealthily<br>- Collects sensitive information<br>- Often bundled with legitimate software                | Bundled software, websites       | Data theft, privacy invasion                 | Keyloggers, Pegasus        |


**Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Use antivirus and anti-malware tools.  
  - Regularly update software.  
  - Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources.

#### 2. Phishing

Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.  

**Types of Phishing**:  

  - **Email Phishing**: Fake emails with malicious links or attachments.  
  - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.  
  - **Smishing and Vishing**: Use of SMS or voice calls for phishing.  
  - **Whaling**: Targeting high-profile individuals (e.g., executives).  

**Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Verify the source of emails and messages.  
  - Avoid clicking on suspicious links.  
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### 3. DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attacks

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is one in which a cyberattacker attempts to overwhelm systems, servers, and networks with traffic to prevent users from accessing them. 

A larger-scale DoS attack is known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, where a much larger number of sources are used to flood a system with traffic.

**Difference**:  
  - DoS originates from a single source.  
  - DDoS originates from multiple sources (e.g., botnets).  

**Impact**:  
  - Service outages.  
  - Revenue losses for businesses.  
  - Reputational damage.  

**Prevention Techniques**:  
  - Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  
  - Use content delivery networks (CDNs).  
  - Monitor traffic patterns for anomalies.

## Risk

Risk is the probability of a negative (harmful) event occurring as well as the potential of scale of that harm.

How to measure risk 

1. Estimate how often an adversary or attacker is likely to attempt to exploit a vulnerability to cause the desired harm.

2. Gauge how well your existing systems, controls and processes can standup to those attempts.

3. Determine the value of the impact or harm the adversary may cause if the adversary is indeed successful.

### Risk = threat x vulnerability
