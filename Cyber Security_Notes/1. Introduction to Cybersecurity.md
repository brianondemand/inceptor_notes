# Cyber Security Fundamentals 


#### 1. Confidentiality

**Confidentiality is about preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties.**

It also means trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data private and anonymous. 

Often confidentiality is compromised by cracking poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, disclosing sensitive data.

Standard measures to establish confidentiality include:

- Data encryption

- Two-factor authentication

- Biometric verification

- Security tokens

---
#### 2. Integrity 

**Integrity refers to protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties.** 

Standard measures to guarantee integrity include: 

- Cryptographic checksums 

- Using file permissions

- Uninterrupted power supplies

- Data backups

---
#### 3. Availability 

**Availability is making sure that authorized parties are able to access the information when needed.** 

Standard measures to guarantee availability include:

- Backing up data to external drives

- Implementing firewalls

- Having backup power supplies

- Data redundancy

# Types of Cyber Attacks 


A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. 

It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft. 

Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories: 

1) Web-based attacks 
2) System-based attacks

- These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network.


---

### Web-based attacks 

These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications.

 1. **Injection Attacks**

- Data is injected into a web application to manipulate it and fetch required information.

**Examples**: 
  - SQL Injection
  - Code Injection
  - Log Injection
  - XML Injection
---

 2. **DNS Spoofing**

- A type of computer security hacking where data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache. This causes the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attacker’s computer or another unauthorized computer.

**Key Points**:
  - Attacks can go undetected for long periods.
  - Leads to significant security issues.

---

 3. **Session Hijacking**

- A security attack on a user session over a protected network.

**Mechanism**:
  - Web applications create cookies to store user sessions.
  - Attackers steal cookies to access user data.

---

 4. **Phishing**

- An attack attempting to steal sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers.

**Mechanism**:
  - Attackers masquerade as trustworthy entities in electronic communication.

---

5. **Brute Force**

- A trial-and-error attack to guess user data, such as passwords or personal identification numbers.

**Uses**:
  - Criminals: Crack encrypted data.
  - Security Analysts: Test network security.

---

6. **Denial of Service (DoS)**

- Makes a server or network resource unavailable to users by flooding the target with traffic or sending crash-inducing information.

**Types**:

  1. **Volume-based Attacks**: Saturate bandwidth, measured in bits per second.
  2. **Protocol Attacks**: Consume server resources, measured in packets.
  3. **Application Layer Attacks**: Crash the web server, measured in requests per second.

---

7. **Dictionary Attacks**

- A method of guessing passwords by validating them against a list of commonly used passwords.

---

 8. **URL Interpretation**

- Changing certain parts of a URL to trick a web server into delivering unauthorized web pages.

---

9. **File Inclusion Attacks**

- Allows attackers to:

  - Access unauthorized or sensitive files on a web server.
  - Execute malicious files via the server's include functionality.

---

10. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**

- An attacker intercepts the connection between a client and server, acting as a bridge between them.

- **Consequences**:
  - Reading, inserting, or modifying intercepted data.

---

### System-Based Attacks

These attacks are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Below are some important system-based attacks:

1. **Virus**
- A malicious software program that spreads through computer files without user knowledge.

**Characteristics**: 
- Self-replicating. 
- Inserts copies of itself into other programs when executed. 
- Can execute harmful instructions to compromise the system.

---

2. Worm
- A type of malware designed to replicate itself and spread to uninfected computers.

**Characteristics**: 
- Functions similarly to a computer virus.
- Often originates from email attachments appearing to be from trusted senders.

---

3. Trojan Horse
- A malicious program that causes unexpected changes to computer settings and unusual activity, even when idle.

**Mechanism**: 
- Misleads users about its true intent. 
- Appears as a normal application but runs malicious code in the background when executed.

---

4. Backdoors
- A method that bypasses the normal authentication process.

**Purpose**:
- May be created by developers to access applications or operating systems for troubleshooting or other purposes.

---

5. Bots
- An automated process that interacts with network services.

**Types**:
  - Good Bots: Examples include web crawlers and chatroom bots.
  - Malicious Bots: Execute harmful tasks, often controlled remotely.

**Execution**: 
- Some bots run automatically. 
- Others execute commands based on specific inputs.

### Cyber Warfare

Cyber warfare refers to the use of digital attacks

Cyber warfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through, for example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks.

### Cyber Crime

Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device.

Cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. Cybercrime is carried out by individuals or organizations. 

Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.

### Cyber Terrorism

Cyber terrorism is the convergence of cyberspace and terrorism. 

It refers to unlawful attacks and threats of attacks against computers, networks and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. 

Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, Denial-of-service attacks, or terroristic threats made via electronic communication.


### Cyber Espionage

Cyber spying, or cyber espionage, is the act or practice of obtaining secrets and information without the permission and knowledge of the holder of the information from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage using methods on the Internet.

---
# Types of Cyber Criminals


### 1. Identity Thieves

Identity thieves are cyber criminals who try to gain access to their victims’ personal information – name, address, phone number, place of employment, bank account, credit card information and social security number. 

They use this information to make financial transactions while impersonating their victims.

### 2. Internet Stalkers

Internet stalkers are individuals who maliciously monitor the online activity of their victims to terrorize and/or acquire personal information. 

This form of cyber crime is conducted through the use of social networking platforms and malware, which are able to track an individual’s computer activity with very little detection. 

The motives for such attacks can differ depending on the cyber criminal, but many internet stalkers seek to acquire important information that they can use for bribery, slander, or both.

### 3. Phishing Scammers

Phishers are cyber criminals who attempt to get ahold of personal or sensitive information through victims’ computers. 

This is often done via phishing websites that are designed to copycat small-business, corporate or government websites. 

Unsuspecting computer users often fall prey to such activities by unknowingly providing personal information including home addresses, social security numbers, and even bank passwords.

### 4. Cyber Terrorists

Cyber terrorism is a well-developed, politically inspired cyber attack in which the cyber criminal attempts to steal data and/or corrupt corporate or government computer systems and networks, resulting in harm to countries, businesses, organizations, and even individuals.


### 5. Hackers

The term hacker may refer to anyone with technical skills, however, it typically refers to an individual who uses his or her skills to achieve unauthorized access to systems or networks to commit crimes.

Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.

#### Types Of Hackers

**Black hat hackers**

Black hat hackers are the "bad guys" of the hacking scene. 

They go out of their way to discover vulnerabilities in computer systems and software to exploit them for financial gain or for more malicious purposes, such as to gain reputation, carry out corporate espionage, or as part of a nation-state hacking campaign. 

**White hat hackers**

White hat hackers can be seen as the “good guys” who attempt to prevent the success of black hat hackers through proactive hacking. 

They use their technical skills to break into systems to assess and test the level of network security, also known as ethical hacking. 

This helps expose vulnerabilities in systems before black hat hackers can detect and exploit them. 

**Grey hat hackers**

Grey hat hackers sit somewhere between the good and the bad guys. 

Unlike black hat hackers, they attempt to violate standards and principles but without intending to do harm or gain financially. 

Their actions are typically carried out for the common good. 

For example, they may exploit a vulnerability to raise awareness that it exists, but unlike white hat hackers, they do so publicly. This alerts malicious actors to the existence of the vulnerability.

## Careers in Cyber Security

### Security Analyst

Responsible for maintaining the security of an organisation's data.

Security analysts are integral to constructing security measures across organisations to protect the company from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

### Responsibilities

- Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
- Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
- Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

### Security Engineer

Design, monitor and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.

Security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

### Responsibilities

- Testing and screening security measures across software
- Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
- Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

### Incident Responder

Identifies and mitigates attacks whilst an attackers operations are still unfolding

Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.

### Responsibilities

- Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
- Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
- Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

### Digital Forensics Examiner

Responsible for using digital forensics to investigate incidents and crimes.

If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement department, you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.

### Responsibilities

- Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
- Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
- Document your findings and report on the case


### Malware Analyst

Analyses all types of malware to learn more about how they work and what they do.

A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

### Responsibilities

- Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
- Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
- Document and report all the findings

### Penetration Tester

Responsible for testing technology products for security loopholes.

You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

### Responsibilities

- Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
- Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

### Red Teamer

Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organisation and providing feedback from an enemies perspective.

Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

### Responsibilities

- Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
- Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
- Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
