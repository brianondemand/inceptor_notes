# Cyber Security Fundamentals 


#### 1. Confidentiality

**Confidentiality is about preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties.**

It also means trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data private and anonymous. 

Often confidentiality is compromised by cracking poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, disclosing sensitive data.

Standard measures to establish confidentiality include:

- Data encryption

- Two-factor authentication

- Biometric verification

- Security tokens

---
#### 2. Integrity 

**Integrity refers to protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties.** 

Standard measures to guarantee integrity include: 

- Cryptographic checksums 

- Using file permissions

- Uninterrupted power supplies

- Data backups

---
#### 3. Availability 

**Availability is making sure that authorized parties are able to access the information when needed.** 

Standard measures to guarantee availability include:

- Backing up data to external drives

- Implementing firewalls

- Having backup power supplies

- Data redundancy

# Types of Cyber Attacks 


A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. 

It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft. 

Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories: 

1) Web-based attacks 
2) System-based attacks

- These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network.


---

### Web-based attacks 

These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications.

 1. **Injection Attacks**

- Data is injected into a web application to manipulate it and fetch required information.

**Examples**: 
  - SQL Injection
  - Code Injection
  - Log Injection
  - XML Injection
---

 2. **DNS Spoofing**

- A type of computer security hacking where data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache. This causes the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attacker’s computer or another unauthorized computer.

**Key Points**:
  - Attacks can go undetected for long periods.
  - Leads to significant security issues.

---

 3. **Session Hijacking**

- A security attack on a user session over a protected network.

**Mechanism**:
  - Web applications create cookies to store user sessions.
  - Attackers steal cookies to access user data.

---

 4. **Phishing**

- An attack attempting to steal sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers.

**Mechanism**:
  - Attackers masquerade as trustworthy entities in electronic communication.

---

5. **Brute Force**

- A trial-and-error attack to guess user data, such as passwords or personal identification numbers.

**Uses**:
  - Criminals: Crack encrypted data.
  - Security Analysts: Test network security.

---

6. **Denial of Service (DoS)**

- Makes a server or network resource unavailable to users by flooding the target with traffic or sending crash-inducing information.

**Types**:

  1. **Volume-based Attacks**: Saturate bandwidth, measured in bits per second.
  2. **Protocol Attacks**: Consume server resources, measured in packets.
  3. **Application Layer Attacks**: Crash the web server, measured in requests per second.

---

7. **Dictionary Attacks**

- A method of guessing passwords by validating them against a list of commonly used passwords.

---

 8. **URL Interpretation**

- Changing certain parts of a URL to trick a web server into delivering unauthorized web pages.

---

9. **File Inclusion Attacks**

- Allows attackers to:

  - Access unauthorized or sensitive files on a web server.
  - Execute malicious files via the server's include functionality.

---

10. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**

- An attacker intercepts the connection between a client and server, acting as a bridge between them.

- **Consequences**:
  - Reading, inserting, or modifying intercepted data.

---

### System-Based Attacks

These attacks are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Below are some important system-based attacks:

1. **Virus**
- A malicious software program that spreads through computer files without user knowledge.

**Characteristics**: 
- Self-replicating. 
- Inserts copies of itself into other programs when executed. 
- Can execute harmful instructions to compromise the system.

---

2. Worm
- A type of malware designed to replicate itself and spread to uninfected computers.

**Characteristics**: 
- Functions similarly to a computer virus.
- Often originates from email attachments appearing to be from trusted senders.

---

3. Trojan Horse
- A malicious program that causes unexpected changes to computer settings and unusual activity, even when idle.

**Mechanism**: 
- Misleads users about its true intent. 
- Appears as a normal application but runs malicious code in the background when executed.

---

4. Backdoors
- A method that bypasses the normal authentication process.

**Purpose**:
- May be created by developers to access applications or operating systems for troubleshooting or other purposes.

---

5. Bots
- An automated process that interacts with network services.

**Types**:
  - Good Bots: Examples include web crawlers and chatroom bots.
  - Malicious Bots: Execute harmful tasks, often controlled remotely.

**Execution**: 
- Some bots run automatically. 
- Others execute commands based on specific inputs.

### Cyber Warfare

Cyber warfare refers to the use of digital attacks

Cyber warfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through, for example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks.

### Cyber Crime

Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device.

Cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. Cybercrime is carried out by individuals or organizations. 

Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.

### Cyber Terrorism

Cyber terrorism is the convergence of cyberspace and terrorism. 

It refers to unlawful attacks and threats of attacks against computers, networks and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. 

Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, Denial-of-service attacks, or terroristic threats made via electronic communication.


### Cyber Espionage

Cyber spying, or cyber espionage, is the act or practice of obtaining secrets and information without the permission and knowledge of the holder of the information from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage using methods on the Internet.

# Types of Cyber Criminals


### 1. Identity Thieves

Identity thieves are cyber criminals who try to gain access to their victims’ personal information – name, address, phone number, place of employment, bank account, credit card information and social security number. 

They use this information to make financial transactions while impersonating their victims.

### 2. Internet Stalkers

Internet stalkers are individuals who maliciously monitor the online activity of their victims to terrorize and/or acquire personal information. 

This form of cyber crime is conducted through the use of social networking platforms and malware, which are able to track an individual’s computer activity with very little detection. 

The motives for such attacks can differ depending on the cyber criminal, but many internet stalkers seek to acquire important information that they can use for bribery, slander, or both.

### 3. Phishing Scammers

Phishers are cyber criminals who attempt to get ahold of personal or sensitive information through victims’ computers. 

This is often done via phishing websites that are designed to copycat small-business, corporate or government websites. 

Unsuspecting computer users often fall prey to such activities by unknowingly providing personal information including home addresses, social security numbers, and even bank passwords.

### 4. Cyber Terrorists

Cyber terrorism is a well-developed, politically inspired cyber attack in which the cyber criminal attempts to steal data and/or corrupt corporate or government computer systems and networks, resulting in harm to countries, businesses, organizations, and even individuals.


### 5. Hackers

The term hacker may refer to anyone with technical skills, however, it typically refers to an individual who uses his or her skills to achieve unauthorized access to systems or networks to commit crimes.

Hacking in cyber security refers to the misuse of devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks to cause damage to or corrupt systems, gather information on users, steal data and documents, or disrupt data-related activity.

#### Types Of Hackers

**Black hat hackers**

Black hat hackers are the "bad guys" of the hacking scene. 

They go out of their way to discover vulnerabilities in computer systems and software to exploit them for financial gain or for more malicious purposes, such as to gain reputation, carry out corporate espionage, or as part of a nation-state hacking campaign. 

**White hat hackers**

White hat hackers can be seen as the “good guys” who attempt to prevent the success of black hat hackers through proactive hacking. 

They use their technical skills to break into systems to assess and test the level of network security, also known as ethical hacking. 

This helps expose vulnerabilities in systems before black hat hackers can detect and exploit them. 

**Grey hat hackers**

Grey hat hackers sit somewhere between the good and the bad guys. 

Unlike black hat hackers, they attempt to violate standards and principles but without intending to do harm or gain financially. 

Their actions are typically carried out for the common good. 

For example, they may exploit a vulnerability to raise awareness that it exists, but unlike white hat hackers, they do so publicly. This alerts malicious actors to the existence of the vulnerability.
