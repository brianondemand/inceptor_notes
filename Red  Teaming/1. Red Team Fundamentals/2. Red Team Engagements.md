### Introduction

Red team engagements are structured simulations of cyberattacks aimed at testing and improving an organization's security posture. They include exercises like:

- Tabletop simulations

- Adversary emulation

- Physical assessments


**Key Goals:**

- Understand red team components.

- Learn how to plan based on client needs, resources, and TTPs.

- Write proper engagement documentation.


###  Defining Scope and Objectives

Success begins with **clear client objectives**. These objectives guide the entire engagement and should be mutually understood.

**Types of engagements:**

- **General Internal/Network Penetration Tests**: Broad, standard testing.

- **Focused Adversary Emulation**: Targets specific threat groups (e.g., APT38).


**Scope** defines **what is in or out of bounds**, e.g.:

- “No exfiltration of data”

- “10.0.3.8/18 is out of scope”

- “System downtime is not permitted”


**Red teams must understand these deeply** and plan their approach accordingly.

### Rules of Engagement (RoE)

Rules of Engagement (ROE) in red teaming are a set of guidelines and constraints that define the scope, objectives, and authorized actions for a simulated attack designed to test an organization's security posture. 

RoE is a **legally binding document** outlining:

- Client goals

- Scope

- Specific limitations (e.g., no DoS attacks)


Acts as the formal **contract** between the client and red team. Common RoE sections include:

- Authorization

- Scope

- Allowed techniques

- Prohibited actions


Example: Red team may not attack certain IP ranges or use malware.

### Campaign Planning

Focuses on translating RoE and objectives into **specific operational plans** using structured planning formats inspired by military operations.

**Four primary planning documents:**

1. Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

2. Resource Plan

3. Operations Plan

4. Mission Plan

Each plan can be found in the table below with a brief explanation.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Type of Plan**|**Explanation of Plan**|**Plan Contents**|
|Engagement Plan|An overarching description of technical requirements of the red team.|CONOPS, Resource and Personnel Requirements, Timelines|
|Operations Plan|An expansion of the Engagement Plan. Goes further into specifics of each detail.|Operators, Known Information, Responsibilities, etc.|
|Mission Plan|The exact commands to run and execution time of the engagement.|Commands to run, Time Objectives, Responsible Operator, etc.|
|Remediation Plan|Defines how the engagement will proceed after the campaign is finished.|Report, Remediation consultation, etc.|

Each adds a layer of depth, from high-level summaries to specific tasks and tools.

---

### Engagement Documentation

Engagement documentation is an extension of campaign planning where ideas and thoughts of campaign planning are officially documented. In this context, the term "document" can be deceiving as some plans do not require proper documentation and can be as simple as an email; this will be covered later in this task.

Formalizes campaign planning through various documents.


**Engagement Plan:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Component**|**Purpose**|
|CONOPS (Concept of Operations)|Non-technically written overview of how the red team meets client objectives and target the client.|
|Resource plan|Includes timelines and information required for the red team to be successful—any resource requirements: personnel, hardware, cloud requirements.|

**Operations Plan:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Component**|**Purpose**|
|Personnel|Information on employee requirements.|
|Stopping conditions|How and why should the red team stop during the engagement.|
|RoE (optional)|-|
|Technical requirements|What knowledge will the red team need to be successful.|

**Mission Plan:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Component**|**Purpose**|
|Command playbooks (optional)|Exact commands and tools to run, including when, why, and how. Commonly seen in larger teams with many operators at varying skill levels.|
|Execution times|Times to begin stages of engagement. Can optionally include exact times to execute tools and commands.|
|Responsibilities/roles|Who does what, when.|

**Remediation Plan (optional):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Component|Purpose|
|Report|Summary of engagement details and report of findings.|
|Remediation/consultation|How will the client remediate findings? It can be included in the report or discussed in a meeting between the client and the red team.|

These are essential for clarity, coordination, and ensuring the engagement runs smoothly.

### Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

The Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is a part of the engagement plan that details a high-level overview of the proceedings of an engagement; we can compare this to an executive summary of a penetration test report. 

The document will serve as a business/client reference and a reference for the red cell to build off of and extend to further campaign plans.

The CONOPS document should be written from a semi-technical summary perspective, assuming the target audience/reader has zero to minimal technical knowledge. 

Although the CONOPS should be written at a high level, you should not omit details such as common tooling, target group, etc. 

As with most red team documents, there is not a set standard of a CONOPS document; below is an outline of critical components that should be included in a CONOPS

- Client Name
- Service Provider
- Timeframe
- General Objectives/Phases
- Other Training Objectives (Exfiltration)
- High-Level Tools/Techniques planned to be used
- Threat group to emulate (if any)



---

### Resource Plan

The resource plan is the second document of the engagement plan, detailing a brief overview of dates, knowledge required (optional), resource requirements. The plan extends the CONOPS and includes specific details, such as dates, knowledge required, etc.

Unlike the CONOPS, the resource plan should not be written as a summary; instead, written as bulleted lists of subsections. As with most red team documents, there is no standard set of resource plan templates or documents; below is an outline of example subsections of the resource plan.

- Header
    - Personnel writing
    - Dates
    - Customer
- Engagement Dates
    - Reconnaissance Dates
    - Initial Compromise Dates
    - Post-Exploitation and Persistence Dates
    - Misc. Dates
- Knowledge Required (optional)
    - Reconnaissance
    - Initial Compromise
    - Post-Exploitation
- Resource Requirements
    - Personnel
    - Hardware
    - Cloud
    - Misc.

The key to writing and understanding a resource plan is to provide enough information to gather what is required but not become overbearing. The document should be straight to the point and define what is needed.

---

### Operations Plan

Contains **detailed actions**, halting conditions, and especially the **communication plan** (e.g., vectr.io, Slack, email).

**Sections may include:**

- Assigned personnel

- Specific attack methods (e.g., spearphishing)

- Escalation protocols

- Rules of engagement


Key detail: If there’s a **system outage**, the red team must **stop** (not continue).

---

### Mission Plan

The mission plan is a cell-specific document that details the exact actions to be completed by operators. The document uses information from previous plans and assigns actions to them.

How the document is written and detailed will depend on the team; as this is an internally used document, the structure and detail have less impact. 

As with all the documents outlined in this room, presentation can vary; this plan can be as simple as emailing all operators. 

Below is a list of the minimum detail that cells should include within the plan.

- Objectives
- Operators
- Exploits/Attacks
- Targets (users/machines/objectives)
- Execution plan variations

The two plans can be thought of similarly; the operations plan should be considered from a business and client perspective, and the mission plan should be thought of from an operator and red cell perspective.
