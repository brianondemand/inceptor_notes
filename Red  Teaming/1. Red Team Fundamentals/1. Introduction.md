Cybersecurity is a constant race between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. As threats in the cyber-world evolve, so does the need for more specialized services that allow companies to prepare for real attacks the best they can.

While conventional security engagements like vulnerability assessments and penetration tests could provide an excellent overview of the technical security posture of a company, they might overlook some other aspects that a real attacker can exploit. In that sense, we could say that conventional penetration tests are good at showing vulnerabilities so that you can take proactive measures but might not teach you how to respond to an actual ongoing attack by a motivated adversary.

## Vulnerability Assessments

A vulnerability assessment is a systematic process to identify, classify, and analyze security weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in an organization's IT systems, applications, and infrastructure. 

It helps organizations understand their security posture and prioritize remediation efforts to mitigate potential risks.

## Penetration Tests

A penetration test, or pentest, is a simulated cyberattack conducted on a computer system, network, or application to evaluate its security. 

It's a proactive measure where a security expert attempts to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that attackers could exploit. This helps organizations strengthen their defenses and improve their security posture. 


## Advanced Persistent Threats

An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated, long-term cyberattack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains hidden for an extended period, typically with the goal of stealing sensitive data or disrupting operations. 

These attacks are characterized by their stealth, persistence, and targeted nature, often involving state-sponsored or highly organized groups. 

While the conventional security engagements we have mentioned cover the finding of most technical vulnerabilities, there are limitations on such processes and the extent to which they can effectively prepare a company against a real attacker. Such limitations include:

As a consequence, some aspects of penetration tests might significantly differ from a real attack, like:

- **Penetration tests are LOUD:** Usually, pentesters won't put much effort into trying to go undetected. Unlike real attackers, they don't mind being easy to detect, as they have been contracted to find as many vulnerabilities as they can in as many hosts as possible.
- **Non-technical attack vectors might be overlooked:** Attacks based on social engineering or physical intrusions are usually not included in what is tested.
- **Relaxation of security mechanisms:** While doing a regular penetration test, some security mechanisms might be temporarily disabled or relaxed for the pentesting team in favor of efficiency. Although this might sound counterintuitive, it is essential to remember that pentesters have limited time to check the network. Therefore, it is usually desired not to waste their time searching for exotic ways to bypass IDS/IPS, WAF, intrusion deception or other security measures, but rather focus on reviewing critical technological infrastructure for vulnerabilities.

On the other hand, real attackers won't follow an ethical code and are mostly unrestricted in their actions. Nowadays, the most prominent threat actors are known as **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**, which are highly skilled groups of attackers, usually sponsored by nations or organised criminal groups. They primarily target critical infrastructure, financial organisations, and government institutions. They are called persistent because the operations of these groups can remain undetected on compromised networks for long periods.


## Red Team Engagements

Red team engagements are security assessments where ethical hackers, acting as simulated adversaries, test an organization's defenses. 

These engagements aim to uncover vulnerabilities, improve detection capabilities, and enhance overall security posture by mimicking real-world attack scenarios. 

Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, a group would take the role of a red team to simulate attack techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a defending team, generally known as **blue team**, against known adversary strategies. 

Translated into the world of cybersecurity, red team engagements consist of emulating a real threat actor's **Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)** so that we can measure how well our blue team responds to them and ultimately improve any security controls in place.

Every red team engagement will start by defining clear goals, often referenced as **crown jewels** or **flags**, ranging from compromising a given critical host to stealing some sensitive information from the target. Usually, the blue team won't be informed of such exercises to avoid introducing any biases in their analysis. 

The red team will do everything they can to achieve the goals while remaining undetected and evading any existing security mechanisms like firewalls, antivirus, EDR, IPS and others. 

Notice how on a red team engagement, not all of the hosts on a network will be checked for vulnerabilities. A real attacker would only need to find a single path to its goal and is not interested in performing noisy scans that the blue team could detect.

Red team engagements also improve on regular penetration tests by considering several attack surfaces:

- **Technical Infrastructure:** Like in a regular penetration test, a red team will try to uncover technical vulnerabilities, with a much higher emphasis on stealth and evasion.
  
- **Social Engineering:** Targeting people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or social media to trick them into revealing information that should be private.
  
- **Physical Intrusion:** Using techniques like lockpicking, RFID cloning, exploiting weaknesses in electronic access control devices to access restricted areas of facilities.

Depending on the resources available, the red team exercise can be run in several ways:

- **Full Engagement:** Simulate an attacker's full workflow, from initial compromise until final goals have been achieved.
  
- **Assumed Breach:** Start by assuming the attacker has already gained control over some assets, and try to achieve the goals from there. As an example, the red team could receive access to some user's credentials or even a workstation in the internal network.
  
- **Table-top Exercise:**  An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats. Ideal for situations where doing live simulations might be complicated.



## Teams and Functions of an Engagement


There are several factors and people involved within a red team engagement. Everyone will have their mindset and methodology to approach the engagement personnel; however, each engagement can be broken into three teams or cells. Below is a brief table illustrating each of the teams and a brief explanation of their responsibilities.

|Team|Definition|
|---|---|
|Red Cell|A red cell is the component that makes up the offensive portion of a red team engagement that simulates a given target's strategic and tactical responses.|
|Blue Cell|The blue cell is the opposite side of red. It includes all the components defending a target network. The blue cell is typically comprised of blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and an organisation's management.|
|White Cell|Serves as referee between red cell activities and blue cell responses during an engagement. Controls the engagement environment/network. Monitors adherence to the ROE. Coordinates activities required to achieve engagement goals. Correlates red cell activities with defensive actions. Ensures the engagement is conducted without bias to either side.|

These teams or cells can be broken down further into an engagement hierarchy.

Since this is a red team-oriented room, we will focus on the responsibilities of the red cell. Below is a table outlining the roles and responsibilities of members of the red team.

|Role|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Red Team Lead|Plans and organises engagements at a high level—delegates, assistant lead, and operators engagement assignments.|
|Red Team Assistant Lead|Assists the team lead in overseeing engagement operations and operators. Can also assist in writing engagement plans and documentation if needed.|
|Red Team Operator|Executes assignments delegated by team leads. Interpret and analyse engagement plans from team leads.|

  
As with most red team functions, each team and company will have its own structure and roles for each team member. The above table only acts as an example of the typical responsibilities of each role.



## Engagement Structure

A core function of the red team is adversary emulation. While not mandatory, it is commonly used to assess what a real adversary would do in an environment using their tools and methodologies. The red team can use various cyber kill chains to summarize and assess the steps and procedures of an engagement.

The blue team commonly uses cyber kill chains to map behaviors and break down an adversaries movement. The red team can adapt this idea to map adversary TTPs (**T**actics, **T**echniques, and **P**rocedures) to components of an engagement.

Many regulation and standardization bodies have released their cyber kill chain. Each kill chain follows roughly the same structure, with some going more in-depth or defining objectives differently. Below is a small list of standard cyber kill chains.

- [Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)
- [Unified Kill Chain](https://unifiedkillchain.com/)
- [Varonis Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cyber-kill-chain/)
- [Active Directory Attack Cycle](https://github.com/infosecn1nja/AD-Attack-Defense)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

In this room, we will commonly reference the "Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain." It is a more standardized kill chain than others and is very commonly used among red and blue teams.

The Lockheed Martin kill chain focuses on a perimeter or external breach. Unlike other kill chains, it does not provide an in-depth breakdown of internal movement. You can think of this kill chain as a summary of all behaviors and operations present.

Components of the kill chain are broken down in the table below.

|Technique|Purpose|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Reconnaissance|Obtain information on the target|Harvesting emails, OSINT|
|Weaponization|Combine the objective with an exploit. Commonly results in a deliverable payload.|Exploit with backdoor, malicious office document|
|Delivery|How will the weaponized function be delivered to the target|Email, web, USB|
|Exploitation|Exploit the target's system to execute code|MS17-010, Zero-Logon, etc.|
|Installation|Install malware or other tooling|Mimikatz, Rubeus, etc.|
|Command & Control|Control the compromised asset from a remote central controller|Empire, Cobalt Strike, etc.|
|Actions on Objectives|Any end objectives: ransomware, data exfiltration, etc.|Conti, LockBit2.0, etc.|


### The Cyber Kill Chain

The Cyber Kill Chain **is a security framework that breaks down a cyberattack into distinct phases, helping organizations understand, detect, and prevent cyber intrusions**.

It outlines the typical steps attackers take, from initial reconnaissance to achieving their objectives. By understanding these stages, security teams can identify vulnerabilities and implement countermeasures at each phase, strengthening their overall security posture. 

The seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain, as defined by Lockheed Martin, are: 

**1. Reconnaissance:**

Gathering information about the target, including identifying vulnerabilities. 

**2. Weaponization:**

Developing a malicious payload (like malware) tailored to exploit the identified vulnerabilities. 

**3. Delivery:**

Transmitting the malicious payload to the target, often through phishing emails or compromised websites. 

**4. Exploitation:**

Executing the malware to take advantage of the vulnerability and gain initial access. 

**5. Installation:**

Installing malware on the target system to maintain persistence. 

**6. Command and Control:**

Establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system to enable further actions. 

**7. Actions on Objectives:**

Carrying out the attacker's ultimate goals, such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or other malicious activities. 

By understanding these stages, security teams can implement various defensive measures at each phase, such as detection, denial, disruption, degradation, and deception, to mitigate the attack's impact.
