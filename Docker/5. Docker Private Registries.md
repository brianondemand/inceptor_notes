Docker registries are central image repositories strictly meant to store and distribute Docker images. Such images form the block for any application that can be containerized, with the package containing the application's source code, runtime environment, service dependencies, and configuration files. In this regard, Docker registries make it easy for individual developers or teams to share their work and deploy their containerized applications in different environments.

## Types of Docker Registries (Public vs. Private)

Docker registries can be generally categorized into two types −

- **Public Registries** − They are made publicly available and usually contain many pre-built images. The most popular public registry is DockerHub, which contains thousands of official and community-contributed images.
- **Private Registries** − Those that are hosted on your infrastructure or cloud, offering limited or restricted access. These are useful when storing proprietary images sensitive data, or images with unique compliance requirements. Some popular private registry options include Docker Registry (open source), Harbor (open source), Nexus Repository, and JFrog Artifactory.

## Popular Docker Registry Options


### Docker Hub (Official Registry)

Docker Hub is the official cloud-based registry service for all Docker images. It is a central location where developers can store and have access to share container images. Docker Hub offers public and private repositories, and hence, it is an all-around solution for both open-source projects and private enterprise applications. Here are a few features −

- **Large Ecosystem** − Docker Hub operates millions of container images shared by a vast developer community, offering official images from Docker and verified publishers.
- **Automated Builds** − Docker Hub can automatically build images from source code hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket.
- **Webhooks** − Allow for the triggering of actions after a successful push to a repository.
- **Content Trust** − Authenticity and integrity of images.
- **Seamlessly integrated with the Docker CLI** − Can pull and push images from the command line interface.

### Self-Hosted Registries

Self-hosted registries provide significantly more control over the storage and distribution of Docker images, especially for organizations with strict security, compliance, or performance requirements. Popular self-hosted registry solutions include −

#### Docker Registry (Open Source)

Docker Registry is a basic open-source project that many other registries, such as Docker Hub, are based on. It is a simple way to host your very own private registry.

- **Simplicity** − Deploy and configure easily.
- **Customization** − Highly customizable through its configuration files.
- **Scalability** − Can scale horizontally using a distributed storage backend.
- **Security** − It provides means for TLS-encrypted communications and basic authentication.
- **Extensible** − Additional functionalities can be added through middleware.

#### Nexus Repository

Sonatype Nexus Repository is a universal and versatile repository manager. It supports most of the repository formats, including Docker images.

- **Universal Format Support** − Not only Docker, it supports formats like Maven, npm, NuGet, and many more.
- **Security** − Works with the security tool, IQ server integrating security.
- **High Availability** − Clustering with support for load balancing, high availability, and redundancy.
- **Integration** − Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools to operationalize the DevOps pipeline fully.
- **Enterprise Features** − Contains advanced features like Staging, Promotion, and Cleanup policies.

#### JFrog Artifactory

JFrog Artifactory is a universal binary repository manager that supports all major package formats, including Docker images.

- **Universal Repository** − Controls all artifacts from development to production.
- **Security and Compliance** − Comes with Xray to perform deep recursive scanning of Docker images.
- **High Availability** − Provides multi-site replication and high-availability configurations.
- **Automation** − It integrates well with various CI/CD tools for automated builds and deployments.
- **Advanced Caching** − Intelligent caching speeds up access to frequently used images.

### Cloud-Based Registries

Cloud-based registries provide managed services to store and distribute Docker images with another cloud service. Here are a few common ones −

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry integrated with AWS.

- **Integration with AWS** − Deep integration with the broader AWS toolset, including ECS, EKS, and CodePipeline.
- **Scalability** − It can scale in size and number of images stored.
- **Security** − Provides image encryption, IAM for controlling access, and network integration.
- **Image Scanning** − The images are scanned for software vulnerability through Amazon Inspector.
- **Cost-Effective** − Pay-as-you-go pricing model with free tier options.

#### Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Microsoft Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service provided as part of Microsoft's Azure cloud.

- **Integration with Azure Services** − Functions seamlessly with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), as well as other Azure DevOps tools.
- **Geo-Replication** − This allows one to replicate the container images to various Azure regions.
- **Security** − Enables integration with Azure Active Directory to allow for Single Sign-On and role-based access control.
- **Automated Workers** − It automates container image builds and updating base images through ACR Tasks.
- **Vulnerability Scanning** − Integrates with security tools to scan for image vulnerabilities.

#### Google Container Registry (GCR)

Google Container Registry is a Docker image storage service for GCP.

- **GCP Integration** − Integrates smoothly with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and other Google Cloud services.
- **Worldwide Available** − Images are stored in several regions worldwide to cover high availability and low latency.
- **Security** − For IAM access control and VPC Service Controls.
- **Vulnerability Scanning** − Automatically scan images for vulnerabilities and provide detailed reports.
- **Ease** − Simplicity in usage with the gcloud command-line tool and integration with Google Cloud Build for CI/CD.

Each of these registry options has its own set of features and competencies for using them in corresponding organizational requirements. Whether you go for flexibility - the self-hosting way - or the ease of cloud services, knowledge about these options can help in making the right choice when it comes to a registry for your containerized applications.

### Key Docker Registry Commands

There are a few important commands you will be using regularly when working with Docker Registries. Here they are −

#### Docker Login

This will authenticate your Docker CLI with a registry. This is required for authentication to push any images into a private registry.

**Example** − Logging in to Docker Hub −

---
#### Docker Tag

This command tags an image with a specific name and tag in preparation for pushing that image into a registry.

```python3
$ docker tag [source_image[:tag]] [repository[:tag]]
```

**Example** − Tag an on-filesystem image for Docker Hub −

```python3
$ docker tag my-app:latest myusername/my-app:latest
```

---
#### Docker Push

Push a tagged image to a Docker registry.

```python3
$ docker push [repository[:tag]]
```

**Example** − Pushing the tagged image to Docker Hub −

```python3
$ docker push myusername/my-app:latest
```

---
#### Docker Pull

This command downloads an image from a Docker registry.

```python3
$ docker pull [repository[:tag]]
```

**Example** − Pulling an image from Docker Hub −

```python3
$ docker pull myusername/my-app:latest
```

## Conclusion

Docker registry management is one of the core capabilities in contemporary development and deployment for containerized applications. Developers can make a choice between Docker Hub, a community-maintained collection of images, or self-hosted and cloud-based services for flexibility, scalability, freedom, and control.
