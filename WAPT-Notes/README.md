## Programming Languages <a href="#ejpt-exam" id="ejpt-exam"></a>

Understanding at least the essential concepts of web markup and programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js, is fundamental. These languages form the backbone of web development and are crucial for both creating and securing web applications.



Developing your own web app can be an excellent way to apply these concepts in practice. By hardening your web app, you can learn how to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This hands-on experience is invaluable for anyone serious about web security.
