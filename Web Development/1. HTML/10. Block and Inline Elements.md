**HTML Block and Inline Elements** refer to two different types of elements in HTML, each with distinct behaviors in terms of layout and how they occupy space on a webpage.

1. **Block Elements**:
    
    - Block elements are typically used to structure the main parts of a webpage, such as headers, paragraphs, and sections.
    - They take up the full width available to them, meaning they usually start on a new line and push the following content to the next line.
    - These elements are often used for creating large sections or chunks of content that should be displayed in a vertical stack.
2. **Inline Elements**:
    
    - Inline elements are used for smaller, specific pieces of content within a block element, such as links, text formatting (like bold or italics), or images.
    - They do not start on a new line. Instead, they only take up as much width as their content requires and sit alongside other inline elements within the same line.
    - Inline elements allow content to flow smoothly in the same line without disrupting the layout of surrounding content.

In summary, block elements are typically used to create structure and divide the content vertically, while inline elements are used for smaller, specific elements that do not disrupt the flow of text.

## The `<div>` Element

The `<div>` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The `<div>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the `<div>` element can be used to style blocks of content.

## The `<span>` Element

The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The `<span>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the `<span>` element can be used to style parts of the text.
