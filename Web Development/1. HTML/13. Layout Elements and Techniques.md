HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

- `<header>` - Defines a header for a document or a section
- `<nav>` - Defines a set of navigation links
- `<section>` - Defines a section in a document
- `<article>` - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- `<aside>` - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- `<footer>` - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- `<details>` - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- `<summary>` - Defines a heading for the `<details>` element

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

- CSS framework
- CSS float property
- CSS flexbox
- CSS grid


**CSS Framework**:

- A CSS framework is a pre-written collection of CSS code that helps developers design websites faster and more efficiently. It includes commonly used styles and layouts, so developers don’t have to write everything from scratch.

 **CSS Float Property**:

- The `float` property in CSS is used to position elements, like images or text, to the left or right within their container. It allows other elements to wrap around them, creating layouts where items can float beside each other.

 **CSS Flexbox**:

- Flexbox is a layout model in CSS that helps you align and distribute space between items in a container, even if their size is unknown or dynamic. It’s especially useful for creating responsive designs where elements adjust their position or size based on the screen size.

 **CSS Grid**:

- CSS Grid is another layout model that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts easily. It divides a container into rows and columns, making it simple to position elements in a two-dimensional grid structure.
