Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!

A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.

## Setting The Viewport

To create a responsive website, add the following `<meta>` tag to all your web pages:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

## Responsive Images

Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

### Using the width Property

If the CSS `width` property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:

```html
<img src="montain.jpg" **style="width:100%;"**>
```

## Using the max-width Property

If the `max-width` property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:

```html
<img src="montain.jpg" style="**max-width:100%;**height:auto;">
```

## Responsive Text Size

The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:

```html
<h1 style="**font-size:10vw**">Hello World</h1>
```

Media queries help websites adapt and look good on various devices by changing styles according to specific requirements, like screen width or orientation.

With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.

```html
<style>  
.left, .right {  float: left;  
  width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */}  
  
.main {  float: left;  
  width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */}  
  
/* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */  
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {  .left, .main, .right {    width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */  }}  
</style>
```
