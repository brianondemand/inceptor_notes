HTTP status messages are short codes and descriptions sent by a web server to your browser (or other clients) to indicate the result of a request. 

They tell you whether the request was successful, failed, or requires some action. These messages are categorized into five groups based on their purpose:

1. **1xx (Informational)**: The server received the request and is processing it.
2. **2xx (Success)**: The request was successful, and the server returned the expected result.
3. **3xx (Redirection)**: The requested resource has moved, and you need to go somewhere else to find it.
4. **4xx (Client Error)**: There was a problem with the request sent by the browser or client.
5. **5xx (Server Error)**: The server encountered an issue and couldn't fulfill the request.

These messages help browsers, users, and developers understand what happened with a web request.
