```html
<html lang="en">  
...  
</html>
```

# ISO Country Codes

In HTML, country codes can be used as an addition to the language code in the `lang` attribute.

The first two characters of a language code defines the language of the Web page.

The last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as language and United States as country:

```html
<html lang="en-US">  
...  
</html>
```
