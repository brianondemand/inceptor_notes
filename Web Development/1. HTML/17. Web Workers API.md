A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. 

You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background:

Worker Script (`index.html`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Count numbers: <output id="result"></output></p>
<button onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button> 
<button onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>

<script>
var w;

function startWorker() {
  if(typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
    if(typeof(w) == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
    }
    w.onmessage = function(event) {
      document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
  } else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers...";
  }
}

function stopWorker() { 
  w.terminate();
  w = undefined;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Worker Script (`worker.js`):

```javascript
let i = 0;

function count() {
    i++;
    postMessage(i);
    setTimeout(count, 1000);
}

count();

```
### Types of Web Workers

1. **Dedicated Workers**:
    
    - Linked to a single script and can only communicate with the thread that created them.
2. **Shared Workers**:
    
    - Can be accessed by multiple scripts, even if they belong to different browser contexts (like different tabs of the same origin).
3. **Service Workers**:
    
    - A specialized type of worker designed for intercepting and handling network requests, caching resources, and enabling offline functionality. These are used in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
