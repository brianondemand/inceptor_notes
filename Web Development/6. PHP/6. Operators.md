Operators in PHP are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They help in mathematical calculations, logical comparisons, string manipulations, and more.  

PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Increment/Decrement operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Array operators
- Conditional assignment operators

### 1. Arithmetic Operators 

Used for performing basic math operations.  

- `+` (Addition) – Adds two numbers.  
  
  ```php
  echo 10 + 5; // Output: 15
  ```

- `-` (Subtraction) – Subtracts one number from another.  
  
  ```php
  echo 10 - 5; // Output: 5
  ```
  
- `*` (Multiplication) – Multiplies two numbers.  
  
  ```php
  echo 10 * 5; // Output: 50
  ```
  
- `/` (Division) – Divides one number by another.  
  
  ```php
  echo 10 / 2; // Output: 5
  ```
  
- `%` (Modulus) – Returns the remainder of division.  
  
  ```php
  echo 10 % 3; // Output: 1
  ```

---

### 2. Assignment Operators  

Used to assign values to variables.  


- `=` (Assign) – Assigns a value to a variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  ```

- `+=` (Add and Assign) – Adds a value and assigns the result.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  $x += 5; // Now $x is 15
  ```

- `-=` (Subtract and Assign) – Subtracts a value and assigns the result.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  $x -= 5; // Now $x is 5
  ```

- `*=` (Multiply and Assign) – Multiplies and assigns the result.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  $x *= 2; // Now $x is 20
  ```

- `/=` (Divide and Assign) – Divides and assigns the result.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  $x /= 2; // Now $x is 5
  ```

- `%=` (Modulus and Assign) – Finds remainder and assigns the result.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 10;
  $x %= 3; // Now $x is 1
  ```

### 3. Comparison Operators  

Used to compare values, returning `true` or `false`.  


- `==` (Equal) – Returns `true` if values are equal.  
  
  ```php
  echo (10 == "10"); // Output: true
  ```

- `===` (Identical) – Returns `true` if values and types are equal.  
  
  ```php
  echo (10 === "10"); // Output: false
  ```

- `!=` (Not Equal) – Returns `true` if values are not equal.  
  
  ```php
  echo (10 != 5); // Output: true
  ```

- `<` (Less Than) – Returns `true` if left is less than right.  
  
  ```php
  echo (5 < 10); // Output: true
  ```

- `>` (Greater Than) – Returns `true` if left is greater than right.  
  
  ```php
  echo (10 > 5); // Output: true
  ```

- `<=` (Less Than or Equal) – Returns `true` if left is less than or equal to right.  
  
  ```php
  echo (5 <= 5); // Output: true
  ```

- `>=` (Greater Than or Equal) – Returns `true` if left is greater than or equal to right.  
  
  ```php
  echo (10 >= 5); // Output: true
  ```

### 4. Logical Operators

Used for evaluating multiple conditions.  


- `&&` (AND) – Returns `true` if both conditions are true.  
  
  ```php
  echo (true && false); // Output: false
  ```

- `||` (OR) – Returns `true` if at least one condition is true.  
  
  ```php
  echo (true || false); // Output: true
  ```

- `!` (NOT) – Reverses a boolean value.  
  
  ```php
  echo !true; // Output: false
  ```

---

### 5. Increment & Decrement Operators  

Used to increase or decrease a variable’s value.  


- `++$x` (Pre-increment) – Increments before using the variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  echo ++$x; // Output: 6
  ```


- `--$x` (Pre-decrement) – Decrements before using the variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  echo --$x; // Output: 4
  ```

- `$x--` (Post-decrement) – Decrements after using the variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  echo $x--; // Output: 5 (then $x becomes 4)
  ```

- `$x++` (Post-increment) – Increments after using the variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  echo $x++; // Output: 5 (then $x becomes 6)
  ````$x++` (Post-increment) – Increments after using the variable.  
  
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  echo $x++; // Output: 5 (then $x becomes 6)
  ```

### 6. String Operators  

Used to manipulate strings.  


- `.` (Concatenation) – Joins two strings together.  
  
  ```php
  $greeting = "Hello " . "World!";
  echo $greeting; // Output: Hello World!
  ```

- `.=` (Concatenation Assignment) – Appends to an existing string.  
  
  ```php
  $text = "Hello";
  $text[[9. Functions]] .= " World!";
  echo $text; // Output: Hello World!
  ```

---

### 7. Ternary Operator  

Shorthand for if-else condition.  

```php
$result = (10 > 5) ? "Greater" : "Smaller";
echo $result; // Output: Greater
```
