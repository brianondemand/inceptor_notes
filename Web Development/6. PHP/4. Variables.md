Variables are "containers" for storing information.

Think of variables as containers for storing data.

### Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables

In PHP, a variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable:

**Example:**

```php
$x = 5;
$y = "John";
```

In the example above, the variable `$x` will hold the value `5`, and the variable `$y` will hold the value `"John"`.

**Note:** When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.

**Note:** Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

A variable can have a short name (like `$x` and `$y` ) or a more descriptive name ( `$age`,`$carname`, `$total_volume` ).

Rules for PHP variables:

- A variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive ( `$age` and `$AGE` are two different variables)

**Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!**

### Output Variables

The PHP `echo` statement is often used to output data to the screen.

The following example will show how to output text and a variable:

**Example :**

```php
$txt = "W3Schools.com";
echo "I love $txt!";
```

The following example will produce the same output as the example above:

**Example :**

```php
$txt = "W3Schools.com";
echo "I love " . $txt . "!";
```

The following example will output the sum of two variables:

**Example :**

```php
$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
```


### PHP is a Loosely Typed Language

In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.

PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.

You donâ€™t need to declare types explicitly, as PHP determines them automatically.

In PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a "Fatal Error" on a type mismatch.

### Variable Types

PHP has no command for declaring a variable, and the data type depends on the value of the variable.

PHP supports the following data types:

- String
- Integer
- Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- Resource

**1. String (`string`)**

Stores a sequence of characters (text).

```php
$name = "John Doe";
echo $name;  // Output: John Doe
```

**2. Integer (`int`)**

Stores whole numbers (positive or negative).

```php
$age = 25;
echo $age;  // Output: 25
```

**3. Float (`float` or `double`)**

Stores decimal numbers.

```php
$price = 99.99;
echo $price;  // Output: 99.99
```

**4. Boolean (`bool`)**

Stores `true` or `false` values.

```php
$is_admin = true;
echo $is_admin;  // Output: 1 (true)
```

**5. Array (`array`)**

Stores multiple values in one variable.

```php
$colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
echo $colors[0];  // Output: Red
```

**6. Object (`object`)**

Stores data and methods related to a class.

```php
class Car {
    public $brand = "Toyota";
}
$myCar = new Car();
echo $myCar->brand;  // Output: Toyota
```

**7. NULL (`NULL`)**

Represents a variable with no value.

```php
$emptyVar = NULL;
var_dump($emptyVar);  // Output: NULL
```

**8. Resource (`resource`)**

Stores external resources like database connections.

```php
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

#### Get the Variable Type

To get the data type of a variable, use the `var_dump()` function.

**Example :**

The `var_dump()` function returns the data type and the value:

```php
$x = 5;
var_dump($x);
```

**Example :**

See what `var_dump()` returns for other data types:

```php
var_dump(5);
var_dump("John");
var_dump(3.14);
var_dump(true);
var_dump([2, 3, 56]);
var_dump(NULL);
```

#### Assign String to a Variable

Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

**Example :**

```php
$x = "John";
echo $x;
```

String variables can be declared either by using double or single quotes, but you should be aware of the differences.

#### Assign Multiple Values

You can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

**Example :**

All three variables get the value "Fruit":

```php
$x = $y = $z = "Fruit";
```

Sample Code:

```php
<?php
$name = "Brian";
?> 

<p> Hello my name is <?php echo $name; ?> and am learning PHP</p>

```

### Differences Between Scalar Types, Arrays, and Object Type in PHP

**1. Scalar Types**  

- Represents a single value.  
- Includes **string, integer, float, and boolean**.  
- Stores basic data without structure.  

**2. Arrays**  

- Stores multiple values in a single variable.  
- Can hold different data types in one collection.  
- Supports indexed and associative structures.  

**3. Object Type**  

- Represents an instance of a class.  
- Contains properties (variables) and methods (functions).  
- Used for structured and reusable code.
