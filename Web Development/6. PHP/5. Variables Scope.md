In PHP, variables can be declared anywhere in the script.

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.

Predefined variables in PHP are built-in global variables that store useful information about the script, server, user input, and environment. They are also known as **superglobals** because they are accessible from anywhere in the script (inside functions, classes, or global scope) without needing to use `global` keyword.

**Key Features of Predefined Variables:**

- **Always available** – No need to declare them manually.
    
- **Superglobals** – Accessible in all scopes.
    
- **Store important data** – Can hold user input, server details, session info, etc.

PHP has three different variable scopes:

- local
- global
- static

## Local and Global Scope

A variable declared **outside** a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:

**Example :**

Variable with global scope:

```php
$x = 5; // global scope

function myTest() {
  // using x inside this function will generate an error
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
```

A variable declared **within** a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

**Example :**

Variable with local scope:

```php
function myTest() {
  $x = 5; // local scope
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

// using x outside the function will generate an error
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
```

You can have local variables with the same name in different functions, because local variables are only recognized by the function in which they are declared.

## PHP The global Keyword

The `global` keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.

To do this, use the `global` keyword before the variables (inside the function):

**Example :**

```php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  global $x, $y;
  $y = $x + $y;
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
```

PHP also stores all global variables in an array called `$GLOBALS[*index*]`. The *`index`* holds the name of the variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.

The example above can be rewritten like this:

**Example :**

```php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
```

## PHP The static Keyword

Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.

To do this, use the `static` keyword when you first declare the variable:

**Example :**

```php
function myTest() {
  static $x = 0;
  echo $x;
  $x++;
}

myTest();
myTest();
myTest();
```

Then, each time the function is called, that variable will still have the information it contained from the last time the function was called.

**Note:** The variable is still local to the function.

### Examples of Predefined Variables in PHP

**1. `$GLOBALS`** – Access Global Variables Inside Functions

```php
<?php
$site = "PHP Learning";

function showSite() {
    echo $GLOBALS['site']; // Access global variable
}

showSite();  // Output: PHP Learning
?>
```

---

**2. `$_SERVER`** – Get Server & Request Information

```php
<?php
echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];  // Output: /index.php (current script name)
echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];  // Output: localhost or domain name
echo $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];  // Output: root document
echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];  // Output: http reqest method
?>
```

---

**3. `$_GET`** – Capture Data from URL Query Parameters

URL: `http://localhost/index.php?name=John`

```php
<?php
echo $_GET['name'];  // Output: John
?>
```

---

**4. `$_POST`** – Capture Data from an HTML Form

```php
<!-- HTML Form -->
<form method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
echo $_POST['username'];  // Output: user input value
?>
```

---

**5. `$_REQUEST`** – Works with Both GET and POST

```php
<?php
echo $_REQUEST['username'];  // Can retrieve GET or POST data
?>
```

---

**6. `$_FILES`** – Handle File Upload

```php
<!-- HTML Form for File Upload -->
<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="myFile">
    <input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
echo $_FILES['myFile']['name'];  // Output: Uploaded file name
?>
```

---

**7. `$_COOKIE`** – Store and Retrieve Cookies

```php
<?php
setcookie("user", "John", time() + 3600);  // Set cookie

echo $_COOKIE['user'];  // Output: John
?>
```

---

**8. `$_SESSION`** – Store Data Across Pages

```php
<?php
session_start();
$_SESSION['user'] = "John";  // Set session

echo $_SESSION['user'];  // Output: John
?>
```

---

**9. `$_ENV`** – Access Environment Variables

```php
<?php
echo $_ENV['PATH'];  // Output: System environment path
?>
```

---

**10. `$argc` & `$argv`** – Command-line Arguments

Run: `php script.php arg1 arg2`

```php
<?php
echo "Arguments Count: " . $argc;  // Output: 3 (script name + 2 args)
print_r($argv);  // Output: Array ([0] => script.php, [1] => arg1, [2] => arg2)
?>
```
