To develop PHP applications fully, especially those involving databases and web servers, installing PHP on your local machine is necessary.

In order to develop and run PHP Web pages, you need to install three vital components on your computer system.

- **Web Server** − PHP will work with virtually all Web Server software, including Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS), NGNIX, or Lighttpd etc. The most often used web server software is the freely available Apache Server. Download Apache for free here [https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
    
- **Database** − PHP will work with virtually all database software, including Oracle and Sybase but most commonly used is freely available MySQL database. Download MySQL for free here - https://www.mysql.com/downloads/
    
- **PHP Parser** − In order to process PHP script instructions a parser must be installed to generate HTML output that can be sent to the Web Browser.
    

**PHP Parser: Software that converts source code into something more easily (and more efficiently) understandable by a computer**

#### Ways to Install PHP on Your Computer

1. **XAMPP** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    
2. **WAMP** (Windows only)
    
3. **LAMP** (Linux only)
    
4. **MAMP** (macOS, Windows)
    
5. **Manual Installation** (Download from PHP official site)
    
6. **Docker** (Containerized PHP environment)



## Install a Local Server With XAMPP

XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use.

There are many precompiled bundles available both in open-source as well as proprietary distributions. XAMPP, from Apache Friends is one of the most popular PHP enabled web server packages.

XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution that contains **A**pache, **M**ariaDB, **P**HP and **P**erl. The letter **X** in the acronym indicates that it is a cross-platform software, available for use on Windows, Linux and OS X. Note that XAMPP includes MariaDB, which is a fork of MySQL, with no difference in its functionality.
