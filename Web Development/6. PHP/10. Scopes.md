In PHP, scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of your code. Understanding how scope works is essential for writing clean, maintainable, and bug-free PHP applications.

## Variable Scopes in PHP

PHP has several different variable scopes:

### 1. Global Scope

Variables declared outside functions have global scope and can be accessed anywhere in the script except within functions.

```php
$globalVar = "I'm a global variable";

function testFunction() {
    // $globalVar is not accessible here by default
    echo $globalVar; // This will generate an undefined variable warning
}
```

To access global variables inside a function, you need to use the `global` keyword:

```php
$globalVar = "I'm a global variable";

function testFunction() {
    global $globalVar;
    echo $globalVar; // Now this works
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `$GLOBALS` superglobal array:

```php
$globalVar = "I'm a global variable";

function testFunction() {
    echo $GLOBALS['globalVar']; // This also works
}
```

### 2. Local Scope

Variables declared within a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function.

```php
function testFunction() {
    $localVar = "I'm a local variable";
    echo $localVar; // This works
}

testFunction();
echo $localVar; // This will generate an undefined variable error
```

---
### 3. Static Variables

The static keyword is also _used to declare variables in a function_ which keep their value after the function has ended.

Static variables retain their value between function calls:

```php
function counter() {
    static $count = 0;
    $count++;
    echo $count;
}

counter(); // Outputs: 1
counter(); // Outputs: 2
counter(); // Outputs: 3
```

---
### 4. Parameter Scope

Function parameters are treated as local variables within the function:

```php
function greet($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}

greet("John"); // $name is only accessible inside the greet function
```

## Variable Scope in Classes

### 1. Property Visibility

When you're inside a **class**, variables are usually called **properties**, and they have **visibility keywords** that control **scope** — meaning who can access them.

The three main visibility types are:

| Visibility  | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`    | Anyone can access it, inside or outside the class            |
| `protected` | Only the class itself and its child classes can access it    |
| `private`   | Only the class itself can access it (NOT even child classes) |

```php
class MyClass {
    public $publicVar = "Accessible everywhere";
    protected $protectedVar = "Accessible in this class and child classes";
    private $privateVar = "Only accessible in this class";
}
```

##### Example

```php
class House {

public $color = "White"; // public - accessible everywhere

protected $rooms = 5; // protected - accessible in House and child classes

private $address = "Nairobi"; // private - accessible only inside House

  

public function showDetails() {

echo "Color: " . $this->color . "<br>";

echo "Rooms: " . $this->rooms . "<br>";

echo "Address: " . $this->address . "<br>";

}

}

  

$myHouse = new House();

  

// echo $myHouse->color;

  

// echo $myHouse->rooms;

// echo $myHouse->address;

  

$myHouse->showDetails();
```

##### Accessing Protected Property from Child Class

```php
class House {
    protected $rooms = 5;
}

class Villa extends House {
    public function showRooms() {
        return "Villa has $this->rooms rooms.";
    }
}

$myVilla = new Villa();
echo $myVilla->showRooms();
```

---
## Closures and Variable Scope

PHP closures (anonymous functions) can capture variables from their parent scope using the `use` keyword:

```php
$message = "Hello";

$greet = function($name) use ($message) {
    echo "$message, $name!";
};

$greet("John"); // Outputs: Hello, John!
```

## Namespace Scope

In PHP, a **namespace** is like a **container** or **folder** for your classes, functions, and constants.  
It **helps organize code** and **prevents name conflicts** when different parts of your project (or different libraries) use the same names.

Namespaces provide a way to group related classes, interfaces, functions, and constants:

```php
namespace MyCompany;

class Manager {
    public function sayHello() {
        echo "Hello from MyCompany Manager!";
    }
}
```
