A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.

A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`:

```php
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
```

The default file extension for PHP files is "`.php`".

A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

**Example:**

A simple `.php` file with both HTML code and PHP code:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

**Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon (`;`).**

### PHP Case Sensitivity

In PHP, keywords (e.g. `if`, `else`, `while`, `echo`, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are equal and legal:

```php
<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?>
```

**Note: However; all variable names are case-sensitive!**

### Comments in PHP

Comments in PHP are used to add notes or disable parts of code without executing them. PHP supports three types of comments:

**1. Single-line Comments (`//` or `#`)**

Used for short comments on a single line.

```php
// This is a single-line comment
echo "Hello, World!";  # Another way to write a single-line comment
```

---

**2. Multi-line Comments (`/* ... */`)**

Used for longer comments spanning multiple lines.

```php
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
echo "PHP comments example.";
```

---

**3. PHPDoc Comments (`/** ... */`)**

Special type of comment used for documentation, especially for functions and classes.

```php
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param int $a First number
 * @param int $b Second number
 * @return int Sum of $a and $b
 */
function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}
```
