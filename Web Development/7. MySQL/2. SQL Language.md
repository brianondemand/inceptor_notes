SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. 

Unlike general-purpose programming languages, SQL focuses exclusively on data operations. It provides a consistent way to query, insert, update, and delete information stored in databases, regardless of which database management system you're using.

### Why SQL is Important

- **Universal Language**: SQL works across various database platforms (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.)
- **Industry Standard**: It's the foundation of data management in virtually every industry
- **Data-centric**: Specifically designed for efficient data operations
- **Declarative**: You specify what you want, not how to get it (the database engine determines the execution)

### Core SQL Concepts

#### Database

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Think of it as a digital filing cabinet where data is stored in a way that makes it easily accessible, manageable, and updateable.

#### Table

A table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, like "customers," "products," or "orders."

Example visualization of a "customers" table:

```
┌────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────────┐
│ customer_id│ first_name  │ last_name  │ email          │
├────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 1          │ John        │ Smith      │ john@email.com │
│ 2          │ Mary        │ Johnson    │ mary@email.com │
│ 3          │ Robert      │ Williams   │ robert@email.com│
└────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴────────────────┘
```

#### Row (Record/Tuple)

A row represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. Each row in a "customers" table would represent one specific customer with all their associated information.

#### Column (Field)

A column represents a specific attribute or piece of information that is stored for each record in the table. Columns have a name and a data type that restricts what values can be stored in them.

#### Primary Key

A primary key is a special column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that:

- No two rows can have the same key value
- The key value cannot be NULL
- Each table can have only one primary key

Example: In a "customers" table, the "customer_id" field might be a primary key.

#### Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column or combination of columns that establishes a link between data in two tables. It creates a reference from one table to another table's primary key, enforcing referential integrity.

Example: In an "orders" table, a "customer_id" column might be a foreign key that references the "customer_id" primary key in the "customers" table, indicating which customer placed each order.



## SQL Categories of Commands


#### DDL (Data Definition Language)

Commands used to define and modify the structure of database objects:

- **CREATE**: Makes new databases, tables, indexes, etc.
- **ALTER**: Modifies existing database objects
- **DROP**: Deletes existing database objects
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table, but keeps the table structure
- **COMMENT**: Adds comments to data dictionary
- **RENAME**: Renames database objects

#### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Commands used to manipulate data within database objects:

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from tables
- **INSERT**: Adds new rows to tables

#### DCL (Data Control Language)

Commands used to control access to data:

- **GRANT**: Gives user's access privileges to database
- **REVOKE**: Takes back privileges granted from users
- **COMMIT**: Saves work done
- **ROLLBACK**: Restores database to original since the last COMMIT
- **SAVEPOINT**: Identifies a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back

#### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Commands used to manage transactions in the database:

- **COMMIT**: Permanently saves the changes made by the current transaction
- **ROLLBACK**: Restores the database to the last committed state
- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a savepoint within a transaction

##  Data Types


#### Numeric Data Types

- **INT**: Standard integer values (typically -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
  
- **TINYINT**: Very small integers (typically -128 to 127, or 0 to 255 if unsigned)
  
- **SMALLINT**: Small integers (typically -32,768 to 32,767)
  
- **MEDIUMINT**: Medium-sized integers (typically -8,388,608 to 8,388,607)

- **FLOAT**: Single-precision floating-point number (approximate numeric data)
  
- **DOUBLE**: Double-precision floating-point number (more precise than FLOAT)
  
- **DECIMAL(p,s)**: Exact numeric data where p is precision (total digits) and s is scale (decimal places)
  

#### String Data Types

- **CHAR(n)**: Fixed-length string of exactly n characters (1-255). Always uses the specified amount of storage regardless of actual content length.
  
- **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length string with maximum length n characters (1-65,535). Only uses as much storage as needed for the actual content plus a length prefix.
  
- **TEXT**: Variable-length string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes
  
- **MEDIUMTEXT**: Variable-length string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 bytes
  
- **LONGTEXT**: Variable-length string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 bytes
  

#### Date and Time Data Types

- **DATE**: Calendar date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (e.g., '2023-07-15')
- **TIME**: Time in 'HH:MM
    
    ' format (e.g., '15:30:45')
- **DATETIME**: Combined date and time in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
    
    ' format (e.g., '2023-07-15 15:30:45')
- **TIMESTAMP**: Similar to DATETIME but automatically updates when a row is modified and handles time zones
  
- **YEAR**: Year in 2-digit or 4-digit format

#### Boolean Data Type

- **BOOLEAN** or **BOOL**: Represents TRUE or FALSE values (often implemented as TINYINT(1) where 0 is FALSE and non-zero is TRUE)

#### Binary Data Types

- **BINARY(n)**: Fixed-length binary string
  
- **VARBINARY(n)**: Variable-length binary string
  
- **BLOB**: Binary Large Object for storing binary data like images or files
  
- **MEDIUMBLOB**: Larger binary object storage
  
- **LONGBLOB**: Very large binary object storage
  

## Common Constraints Explained


#### NOT NULL

The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. NULL represents missing or unknown data, and this constraint forces the user to provide a value for this column when inserting a new row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

#### UNIQUE

The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are different from one another. This prevents duplicate values in the specified column(s).


```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

#### PRIMARY KEY

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. A primary key must contain UNIQUE values and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only one primary key, which can consist of a single column or multiple columns.


```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

Or, when defined as a table constraint:


```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
);
```

#### FOREIGN KEY

A FOREIGN KEY is a column (or combination of columns) that establishes a link between data in two tables. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that values in one table match values in another table.


```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

This constraint ensures that every value in the orders.customer_id column must exist in the customers.customer_id column.

#### DEFAULT

The DEFAULT constraint provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during an INSERT operation.


```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### CHECK

The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.


```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

#### AUTO_INCREMENT

AUTO_INCREMENT allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. This is often used for primary key columns.


```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

With AUTO_INCREMENT, you don't need to specify a value for the customer_id column when inserting new records; the system will automatically assign the next available number.

**Example: Creating a Table with Various Constraints**


```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
    job_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00 CHECK (salary >= 0),
    department_id INT,
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

In this example:

- `employee_id` is the primary key that automatically increments
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `hire_date`, and `job_title` cannot be NULL
- `email` must be unique across all employees
- `salary` defaults to 0.00 and must be non-negative
- `department_id` is linked to the departments table
- `manager_id` is a self-reference to the employees table (for hierarchical relationships)
- If a department or manager is deleted, the corresponding IDs are set to NULL
