## Inserting Data

Inserting data is the process of adding new rows to a table. SQL provides several ways to do this.

### Basic INSERT Statement

The most fundamental way to insert data is with the INSERT INTO statement:


```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

This statement has two parts:

1. Column list: Specifies which columns you're providing values for
2. Values list: Provides the actual values for those columns

Example:


```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_title, department_id)
VALUES ('John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@company.com', '2023-01-15', 'Software Developer', 3);
```

Important notes:

- The column list is optional, but recommended for clarity
- If you omit the column list, you must provide values for ALL columns in the table's defined order
- Columns with DEFAULT values can be omitted from the column list, and the default value will be used
- Columns that allow NULL can be omitted, and NULL will be used
- AUTO_INCREMENT columns can be omitted (or you can specify NULL or 0), and the system will generate the value
- String and date values must be enclosed in quotes

### Inserting Multiple Rows

You can insert multiple rows with a single INSERT statement, which is more efficient than separate statements:


```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES 
    (row1_value1, row1_value2, row1_value3, ...),
    (row2_value1, row2_value2, row2_value3, ...),
    (row3_value1, row3_value2, row3_value3, ...);
```

Example:


```sql
INSERT INTO departments (department_name, location, budget)
VALUES 
    ('Marketing', 'Floor 3', 500000.00),
    ('Engineering', 'Floor 2', 750000.00),
    ('Human Resources', 'Floor 1', 300000.00),
    ('Customer Support', 'Floor 1', 400000.00);
```

### INSERT with SELECT Statement

You can insert data that comes from a query on another table (or the same table):


```sql
INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
```

This approach is useful for:

- Copying data between tables
- Creating backup copies
- Aggregating or transforming data when inserting

Example:


```sql
-- Create a table of high-value employees
INSERT INTO vip_employees (employee_id, full_name, department, salary)
SELECT e.employee_id, CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name), d.department_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 100000;
```

### INSERT IGNORE

In some database systems, you can use INSERT IGNORE to skip error-causing rows while continuing to insert valid rows:


```sql
INSERT IGNORE INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

Example:


```sql
-- This will insert rows that don't violate constraints and skip those that do
INSERT IGNORE INTO employees (email, first_name, last_name)
VALUES 
    ('john@company.com', 'John', 'Smith'),      -- This might be skipped if email already exists
    ('maria@company.com', 'Maria', 'Garcia');   -- This will be inserted if email is unique
```

### INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE

This variation allows you to update existing rows if they cause a unique key violation:


```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    column1 = value1,
    column2 = new_value2;
```

Example:


```sql
-- Insert product, but if product_code already exists, update the price and quantity
INSERT INTO products (product_code, product_name, price, quantity)
VALUES ('ABC123', 'Wireless Mouse', 29.99, 100)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    price = VALUES(price),
    quantity = quantity + VALUES(quantity);
```

## 4. Querying Data

Retrieving data is one of the most common operations in SQL, and the SELECT statement is the workhorse for these operations.

### Basic SELECT Statement Structure


````sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;

Key differences between WHERE and HAVING:
- WHERE filters individual rows before they are grouped
- HAVING filters groups after they are formed
- HAVING can use aggregate functions, WHERE cannot

Examples:

```sql
-- Find departments with more than 5 employees
SELECT 
    department_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- Find departments where the average salary is over $50,000
SELECT 
    department_id, 
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
````

### Combining WHERE and HAVING

You can use both WHERE and HAVING together in the same query:


```sql
-- Find departments hired after 2020 with more than 3 senior employees
SELECT 
    department_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS senior_employees
FROM employees
WHERE 
    hire_date >= '2020-01-01'
    AND job_level = 'Senior'
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

In this example:

1. WHERE filters rows first (only employees hired after 2020 and with 'Senior' level)
2. The filtered rows are grouped by department
3. HAVING then filters the groups (only departments with more than 3 senior employees)

### GROUP BY with ORDER BY

It's common to combine GROUP BY with ORDER BY to sort the grouped results:


```sql
-- Find departments with high average salaries, ordered by average salary
SELECT 
    department_id, 
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

## Joining Tables

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They are essential in relational databases to access data spread across multiple tables.

### Understanding Table Relationships

In a well-designed relational database, data is divided into specialized tables to minimize redundancy. For example:

- An `employees` table might store employee details (ID, name, contact info, salary)
- A `departments` table might store department details (ID, name, location)
- The `employees` table would have a `department_id` column that references the primary key of the `departments` table

To get complete information, you need to join these tables.

### Types of Joins Explained

#### INNER JOIN

Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.


```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Visual representation:

```
Table A       Table B
┌───┬───┐     ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │     │ 1 │ X │
│ 2 │ B │     │ 3 │ Y │
│ 3 │ C │     │ 5 │ Z │
└───┴───┘     └───┴───┘

INNER JOIN result:
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │ X │
│ 3 │ C │ Y │
└───┴───┴───┘
```

Example:


```sql
-- Get employee details with their department names
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

In this query:

- Employees without a department (NULL department_id) are excluded
- Departments without employees are excluded
- Only matching pairs are returned

#### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. When there's no match, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.


```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Visual representation:

```
Table A       Table B
┌───┬───┐     ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │     │ 1 │ X │
│ 2 │ B │     │ 3 │ Y │
│ 3 │ C │     │ 5 │ Z │
└───┴───┘     └───┴───┘

LEFT JOIN result:
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │ X │
│ 2 │ B │NULL│
│ 3 │ C │ Y │
└───┴───┴───┘
```

Example:


```sql
-- Get all employees and their department names (if any)
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

In this query:

- All employees are included, even those without a department
- Employees without a department will have NULL for department_name

#### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. When there's no match, NULL values are returned for the left table's columns.


```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Visual representation:

```
Table A       Table B
┌───┬───┐     ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │     │ 1 │ X │
│ 2 │ B │     │ 3 │ Y │
│ 3 │ C │     │ 5 │ Z │
└───┴───┘     └───┴───┘

RIGHT JOIN result:
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │ X │
│ 3 │ C │ Y │
│NULL│NULL│ Z │
└───┴───┴───┘
```

Example:

```sql
-- Get all departments and their employees (if any)
SELECT 
    d.department_id,
    d.department_name,
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

In this query:

- All departments are included, even those without employees
- Departments without employees will have NULL for employee columns

#### FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. When there's no match, NULL values are returned for the columns from the table without a match.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Visual representation:

```
Table A       Table B
┌───┬───┐     ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │     │ 1 │ X │
│ 2 │ B │     │ 3 │ Y │
│ 3 │ C │     │ 5 │ Z │
└───┴───┘     └───┴───┘

FULL JOIN result:
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │ X │
│ 2 │ B │NULL│
│ 3 │ C │ Y │
│NULL│NULL│ Z │
└───┴───┴───┘
```

Example:

```sql
-- Get all employees and all departments, showing all possible relationships
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.department_id,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

Note: Not all database systems support FULL JOIN directly (MySQL notably does not). In those systems, you can simulate it using a UNION:

```sql
-- FULL JOIN alternative using UNION
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.department_id,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id

UNION

SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.department_id,
    d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL;
```

#### CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables - every row from the first table combined with every row from the second table.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

Visual representation:

```
Table A       Table B
┌───┬───┐     ┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │     │ X │ 10│
│ 2 │ B │     │ Y │ 20│
└───┴───┘     └───┴───┘

CROSS JOIN result:
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ A │ X │ 10│
│ 1 │ A │ Y │ 20│
│ 2 │ B │ X │ 10│
│ 2 │ B │ Y │ 20│
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```

Example:

```sql
-- Generate all possible combinations of products and colors
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    c.color_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN colors c;
```

Use cases for CROSS JOIN:

- Generate combination tables
- Create test data
- Calculate all possible outcomes

### Self JOIN

A self JOIN is when you join a table to itself. This is useful for hierarchical data or when rows within a table are related to other rows in the same table.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table1 t2 ON t1.column = t2.another_column;
```

Example - Employee hierarchy:

```sql
-- Get employees and their managers' names
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name AS employee_name,
    e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

Example - Finding pairs:


```sql
-- Find all product pairs with the same price
SELECT 
    p1.product_id AS product1_id,
    p1.product_name AS product1_name,
    p2.product_id AS product2_id,
    p2.product_name AS product2_name,
    p1.price
FROM products p1
JOIN products p2 ON p1.price = p2.price AND p1.product_id < p2.product_id;
```

### Multiple Joins

You can join more than two tables in a single query:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column
JOIN table3 ON table2.column = table3.column
JOIN table4 ON table3.column = table4.column;
```

Example:

```sql
-- Get order details with customer, product, and employee information
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name,
    od.quantity,
    od.unit_price,
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS sales_person
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN employees e ON o.employee_id = e.employee_id;
```

### Join Performance Considerations

- Always use proper indexes on join columns
- Join on the smallest dataset first when possible
- Be cautious with joining large tables
- Consider denormalizing data for read-heavy operations
- Use EXPLAIN to understand how your joins are executed
- Avoid unnecessary joins when possible
