## **3. Types of Websites**

Websites can be categorized based on their functionality and purpose:

### **A. Based on Functionality**

1. **Static Websites**
    
    - Built using only **HTML and CSS**.
    - Content remains the same for all users.
    - Example: Personal blogs, portfolio websites.
2. **Dynamic Websites**
    
    - Uses **server-side scripting** and databases.
    - Content changes dynamically based on user actions or database updates.
    - Example: Social media platforms, news portals.

### **B. Based on Purpose**

1. **Personal Websites** – Created for personal blogs, portfolios, or resumes.
2. **Business Websites** – Designed to promote businesses and services.
3. **E-commerce Websites** – Websites that allow online buying and selling of products.
4. **Educational Websites** – Provide learning materials, courses, and resources.
5. **Social Media Websites** – Platforms for user interaction and content sharing.
6. **News and Media Websites** – Provide news, articles, and multimedia content.
7. **Portfolio Websites** – Showcases an individual’s or company’s work, skills, or projects.

## **4. Web Development Overview**

Web development is the process of creating, designing, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves different technologies and tools to build both the **frontend (client-side)** and **backend (server-side)** of a website.

---

## **5. Types of Web Development**

### **A. Frontend Development (Client-Side Development)**

Frontend development is responsible for everything users see and interact with on a website. It involves:

#### **Technologies Used in Frontend Development:**

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** – Structures the content of a webpage.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** – Styles and formats the webpage layout.
- **JavaScript** – Adds interactivity, animations, and dynamic elements.

#### **Popular Frontend Frameworks & Libraries:**

- **React.js** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vue.js** – A progressive JavaScript framework for interactive UI.
- **Angular** – A frontend framework developed by Google for building scalable web applications.

---

### **B. Backend Development (Server-Side Development)**

Backend development is responsible for handling data, processing requests, and managing server-side logic.

#### **Technologies Used in Backend Development:**

- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js), Python (Django, Flask), PHP (Laravel), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring Boot).
- **Databases:** SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Firebase).
- **Server Technologies:** Apache, Nginx, Express.js (for Node.js).

---

### **C. Full-Stack Development**

A **full-stack developer** works on both frontend and backend development. They handle everything from designing user interfaces to managing databases and servers.

#### **Popular Full-Stack Technologies:**

- **MERN Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js.
- **MEAN Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js.
- **LAMP Stack:** Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

## **6. Web Development Process**

### **Step 1: Planning & Research**

- Define the website’s purpose and target audience.
- Decide on the features and functionalities needed.
- Create wireframes or prototypes for the website layout.

### **Step 2: Design & User Interface (UI/UX)**

- Design the website’s appearance using tools like **Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch**.
- Ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.

### **Step 3: Development (Coding Phase)**

- Implement **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for frontend development.
- Use **backend programming languages and databases** to manage data.
- Test the website on different devices and browsers.

### **Step 4: Deployment & Hosting**

- Deploy the website using platforms like **Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or DigitalOcean**.
- Register a domain name and set up hosting.

### **Step 5: Maintenance & Updates**

- Fix bugs and security issues.
- Update content and improve performance based on user feedback.

---

## **7. Tools Used in Web Development**

### **A. Code Editors & IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**

- **VS Code** (Most popular).
- Sublime Text.
- Atom.

### **B. Version Control Systems**

- **Git & GitHub** – Track changes and collaborate with other developers.

### **C. Testing & Debugging Tools**

- Chrome DevTools.
- Jest (for JavaScript testing).
- Postman (for API testing).

### **D. Deployment & Hosting Platforms**

- Vercel (for Next.js & React apps).
- Netlify (for static websites).
- Heroku (for backend apps).
