
When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

## Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS


### 1. **External CSS**

- The CSS code is written in a separate file with the `.css` extension.
- It is linked to the HTML document using a `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section.
- Best for maintaining consistency across multiple web pages and separating content (HTML) from design (CSS).

**Key Advantage**: Reusable across multiple pages.


### 2. **Internal CSS**

- The CSS code is written directly inside the HTML document, within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
- It is used when styles are specific to a single page.

**Key Advantage**: Useful for styling a single page without creating an external file.


### 3. **Inline CSS**

- The CSS code is applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.
- Best for applying unique styles to specific elements, but not recommended for large projects.

**Key Advantage**: Quick and easy for small, one-off customizations.


- **External CSS**: Ideal for large projects and consistent styling across pages.
- **Internal CSS**: Useful for single-page applications or overrides.
- **Inline CSS**: Best for quick, specific styles but not scalable.

## Cascading Order

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default

So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.
