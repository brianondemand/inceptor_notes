
## What is CSS?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

```css
body {  background-color: lightblue;}  
  
h1 {  color: white;  
  text-align: center;}  
  
p {  font-family: verdana;  
  font-size: 20px;}
```

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
