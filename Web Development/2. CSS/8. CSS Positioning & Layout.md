## Position Property

`position`: Defines how an element is positioned in a document.

There are five different position values:

- `static`
- `relative`
- `fixed`
- `absolute`
- `sticky`

    ```css
    div {
      position: absolute;
      top: 50px;
      left: 100px;
    }
    ```


#### 1. `static` (Default Position)  

Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.

```css
div {
  position: static;
  top: 20px; 
  left: 30px; 
}
```


#### 2. `relative`  

The element is positioned relative to its normal position.

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px; /* Moves 20px down from its original position */
  left: 30px; /* Moves 30px to the right */
}
```


#### 3. `fixed`  

The element is positioned relative to the viewport and does not move when scrolling.

```css
div {
  position: fixed;
  top: 10px;
  right: 10px;
  background: red;
}
```


#### 4. `absolute`  

The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned (non-static) ancestor.

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
}
```


#### 5. `sticky`  

The element toggles between `relative` and `fixed` depending on scroll position.

```css
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: yellow;
}
```

## The z-index Property

When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

![][https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/images/z-index.png]


The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

**Note**: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).

**Syntax:**

```css
img {  position: absolute;  
  left: 0px;  
  top: 0px;  
  z-index: -1;}
```

##  Overflow Property

	The CSS `overflow` property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.
	
	The `overflow` property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
	
	The `overflow` property has the following values:

- `visible` - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
- `hidden` - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
- `scroll` - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
- `auto` - Similar to `scroll`, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

**Note:** The `overflow` property only works for block elements with a specified height.

#### 1. `visible`

By default, the overflow is `visible`, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box.

```css
div {  width: 200px;  
  height: 65px;  
  background-color: coral;  
  overflow: visible;}
```

#### 2. `hidden`

With the `hidden` value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden.

```css
div {  overflow: hidden;}
```

#### 3. `scroll`

Setting the value to `scroll`, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it).

```css
div {  overflow: scroll;}
```

#### 4. `auto`

The `auto` value is similar to `scroll`, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary.

```css
div {  overflow: auto;}
```

#### 5. `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`

The `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):

`overflow-x` specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.  
`overflow-y` specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.

```css
div {  overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */  
  overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */}
```

## The `float` Property

The `float` property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The `float` property can have one of the following values:

- `left` - The element floats to the left of its container
- `right` - The element floats to the right of its container
- `none` - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
- `inherit` - The element inherits the float value of its parent

In its simplest use, the `float` property can be used to wrap text around images.

```css
img {  float: right;}
```


```css
img {  float: left;}
```

```css
img {  float: none;}
```

**Float Next To Each Other**

```css
div {  float: left;  
  padding: 15px;}  
  
.div1 {  background: red;}  
  
.div2 {  background: yellow;}  
  
.div3 {  background: green;}
```

## The `clear` Property


The `clear` property in CSS is used to control the behavior of elements in relation to floating elements. It prevents an element from being positioned next to a floated element and instead forces it to appear below it.

The `clear` property can have one of the following values:

- `none` - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
- `left` - The element is pushed below left floated elements
- `right` - The element is pushed below right floated elements
- `both` - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
- `inherit` - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

**Without `clear` (Floated Elements Overlapping)**

```html
<div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;">
    Floating Box
</div>
<p>This text wraps around the floated box.</p>
```

**Behavior:**  

The paragraph text will flow around the floated box because the float is not cleared.

---

**With `clear: left;` (Prevent Overlapping)**

```html
<div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;">
    Floating Box
</div>
<p style="clear: left;">This text moves below the floated box.</p>
```

**Behavior:**  

Now, the paragraph is forced **below** the floated box because `clear: left;` prevents it from appearing beside it.

---

**With `clear: both;` (Clearing Both Sides)**

```html
<div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: lightblue;">
    Left Floating Box
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: lightcoral;">
    Right Floating Box
</div>
<p style="clear: both;">This text is forced below both floating elements.</p>
```

**Behavior:**  

The paragraph is placed **below both floated elements** because `clear: both;` clears both `left` and `right` floats.

#### The `clearfix` Hack

If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:

```css
.clearfix {  overflow: auto;}
```

The `overflow: auto` clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). The **new, modern clearfix hack** however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages:

```css
.clearfix::after {  content: "";  
  clear: both;  
  display: table;}
```

## The `display` Property


The `display` property in CSS determines how an element is rendered in the layout. Here’s the difference between `inline`, `inline-block`, and `block` with examples:

### 1. **`display: inline;`**

   - Elements with `inline` display do **not** start on a new line.
   - They only take up as much width as necessary.
   - You **cannot** set width and height explicitly.

   **Example:**
   ```html
<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightblue;">Inline Element 1</span>
<span style="display: inline; background-color: lightgreen;">Inline Element 2</span>
   ```
  
 **Behavior:**  
 
   Both `<span>` elements will appear next to each other without breaking into a new line.

---

### 2. **`display: inline-block;`**

   - Similar to `inline`, but allows setting `width` and `height`.
   - Elements still sit **next to each other** in a line.

   **Example:**
   ```html
   <div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 50px; background-color: lightcoral;">
       Inline-block Element 1
   </div>
   <div style="display: inline-block; width: 150px; height: 50px; background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">
       Inline-block Element 2
   </div>
   ```
   
   **Behavior:**  
   
   Both `<div>` elements will sit side by side, but since `inline-block` allows setting `width` and `height`, they will respect those dimensions.

---

### 3. **`display: block;`**

   - The element **starts on a new line** and takes up the full width available.
   - You **can** set `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding`.

   **Example:**
   ```html
   <div style="display: block; background-color: lightpink; padding: 10px;">
       Block Element 1
   </div>
   <div style="display: block; background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
       Block Element 2
   </div>
   ```
   
   **Behavior:**  
   
   Each `<div>` will appear on a new line, stacking vertically.
