JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a **lightweight data format** used for storing and exchanging data, especially between a server and a web application. It is **language-independent** and is widely used in APIs.

### JSON Syntax Basics

JSON is based on key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects, but with **some differences**:  

**Keys must be strings** (wrapped in double quotes `""`).  
 
**Values can be** strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or `null`.  

**No trailing commas** (unlike JavaScript objects).
