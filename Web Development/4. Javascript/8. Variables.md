Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

- Automatically
- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

**Note:**

It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

The `var` keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The `let` and `const` keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The `var` keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

#### When to Use `var`, `let`, or `const`?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed

3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use `let` if you can't use `const`

5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.
   

#### JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript **variables** must be **identified** with **unique names**.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables do not have fixed data types. Instead, their types are determined at runtime. 

JavaScript has two main categories of data types: **primitive** and **non-primitive** (also known as reference types).

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types include **Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol,** and **BigInt**.

- **Number** represents both integers and floating-point numbers. JavaScript uses a **64-bit floating-point format**, which allows it to handle very large and very small numbers but may introduce precision issues when working with decimals.
  
- **String** represents textual data and can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``). Strings in JavaScript are **immutable**, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.
  
- **Boolean** has only two values: **true** and **false**. It is commonly used in conditional statements and logical operations.
  
- **Null** represents the intentional absence of a value. It is often assigned to variables explicitly to indicate that they do not hold any meaningful value.
  
- **Undefined** is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized. It signifies the absence of a value at the time of access.
  
- **Symbol** was introduced in ES6 and is used to create **unique and immutable identifiers**, often for object properties.
  
- **BigInt** was introduced in ES11 and is used to handle integers larger than the **maximum safe integer limit** in JavaScript, which is **2^53 - 1**. It is created by appending **n** to a number, such as `9007199254740991n`.

### Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types include **Objects, Arrays, and Functions**.

- **Objects** are collections of key-value pairs where values can be **any data type**, including other objects. Objects are created using curly braces `{}` or constructor functions. Example:


    ```javascript
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
    ```

- **Arrays** are a special type of object used for storing **ordered collections** of values. Arrays support various methods like `push()`, `pop()`, and `slice()` for data manipulation. Example:

    ```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    ```

- **Functions** are blocks of reusable code that can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments. They can be defined using **function declarations, function expressions, or arrow functions**. Example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {    return `Hello, ${name}`;}
```


### Type Conversion and Type Checking

JavaScript allows **implicit (type coercion)** and **explicit** type conversions. Implicit conversion happens automatically, such as when a number is added to a string (`5 + "10"` results in `"510"`). Explicit conversion requires using functions like `Number()`, `String()`, or `Boolean()`.

The `typeof` operator is used to check the type of a value. However, it has some inconsistencies, such as returning `"object"` for `null`. Example:

```javascript
console.log(typeof null); // "object"
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"
```

### Mutability and Reference Behavior

Primitive values are **immutable** and stored directly in memory. Non-primitive values (objects, arrays) are stored **by reference**, meaning changes to one reference affect all others.

Understanding JavaScript data types is crucial for writing efficient and error-free code. Since objects and arrays are reference types, modifying them through one variable affects all references to the same object. Developers must be aware of **shallow and deep copies** when working with complex data structures to avoid unintended side effects. Proper handling of data types ensures **robust and maintainable** JavaScript applications.
