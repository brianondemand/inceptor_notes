### JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

- String  
- Number  
- Bigint  
- Boolean  
- Undefined  
- Null  
- Symbol  
- Object


- **Numbers** - are values that can be processed and calculated. You don't enclose them in quotation marks. The numbers can be either positive or negative.

- **Strings** - are a series of letters and numbers enclosed in quotation marks. JavaScript uses the string literally; it doesn't process it. You'll use strings for text you want displayed or values you want passed along.

- **Boolean** (true/false) - lets you evaluate whether a condition meets or does not meet specified criteria.

- **Null** - is an empty value. null is not the same as 0 -- 0 is a real, calculable number, whereas null is the absence of any value.


| **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                                     | **Example**                                   | **Type**      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Number**    | Represents both integer and floating point numbers.                                                 | `let x = 10;``let y = 3.14;`                  | Primitive     |
| **String**    | Represents a sequence of characters (text).                                                         | `let name = "John";``let greeting = 'Hello';` | Primitive     |
| **Boolean**   | Represents a logical entity that can be either `true` or `false`.                                   | `let isActive = true;``let isDone = false;`   | Primitive     |
| **Undefined** | Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.                              | `let x;``console.log(x); // undefined`        | Primitive     |
| **Null**      | Represents the intentional absence of any object value.                                             | `let person = null;`                          | Primitive     |
| **Symbol**    | Represents a unique and immutable value often used for object property keys.                        | `let sym = Symbol('id');`                     | Primitive     |
| **BigInt**    | Represents numbers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` or smaller than `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`. | `let big = 12345678901234567890n;`            | Primitive     |
| **Object**    | Represents collections of data and more complex entities.                                           | `let obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };`       | Non-Primitive |
| **Array**     | Special type of object used for storing ordered collections of data.                                | `let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];`                     | Non-Primitive |
| **Function**  | A block of code designed to perform a particular task.                                              | `function sayHello() { return "Hello!"; }`    | Non-Primitive |
| **Date**      | Used to represent dates and times.                                                                  | `let date = new Date();`                      | Non-Primitive |
| **RegExp**    | Represents regular expressions used for pattern matching in strings.                                | `let regex = /ab+c/;`                         | Non-Primitive |

---

- **Primitive types**: These are basic data types that store simple values (such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.). They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.

- **Non-Primitive types**: These are more complex types, such as objects and arrays, and can store collections of data. They are mutable, meaning their content can be changed.


### The Object Datatype

The object data type can contain both **built-in objects**, and **user defined objects**:

Built-in object types can be:

`objects`, `arrays`, `dates`, `maps`, `sets`, `intarrays`, `floatarrays`, `promises`, and more.
