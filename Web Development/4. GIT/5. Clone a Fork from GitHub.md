Now we have our own `fork`, but only on GitHub. We also want a `clone` on our local Git to keep working on it.

A `clone` is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.

Move back to the **original** repository, and click the green "Code" button to get the `URL` to `clone`:

![GitHub clone URL](https://www.w3schools.com/git/img_github_clone_url.png)

Open your Git bash and `clone` the repository:

### Example

```shell
git clone https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git
Cloning into 'w3schools-test.github.io'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 33, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Total 33 (delta 18), reused 33 (delta 18), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (33/33), 94.79 KiB | 3.16 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (18/18), done.
```

Take a look in your file system, and you will see a new directory named after the cloned project:

### Example

```shell
ls
w3schools-test.github.io/
```

**Note:** To specify a specific folder to clone to, add the name of the folder after the repository `URL`, like this: `git clone https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git *myfolder*`

Navigate to the new directory, and check the `status`:

### Example

```shell
cd w3schools-test.github.io
git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

And check the `log` to confirm that we have the full repository data:

### Example

```shell
git log
commit facaeae8fd87dcb63629f108f401aa9c3614d4e6 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Merge: e7de78f 5a04b6f
Author: w3schools-test 
Date:   Fri Mar 26 15:44:10 2021 +0100

    Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/w3schools-test/hello-world

commit e7de78fdefdda51f6f961829fcbdf197e9b926b6
Author: w3schools-test 
Date:   Fri Mar 26 15:37:22 2021 +0100

    Updated index.html. Resized image
    
.....
```

Now we have a full copy of the original repository.

## Configuring Remotes

Basically, we have a full copy of a repository, whose `origin` we are not allowed to make changes to.

Let's see how the `remotes` of this Git is set up:

### Example

```shell
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```

We see that `origin` is set up to the original " `w3schools-test` " repository, we also want to add our own `fork`.

First, we `rename` the original `origin` `remote`:

### Example

```shell
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote -v
upstream        https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```

Then fetch the `URL` of our own `fork`:

![GitHub clone URL](https://www.w3schools.com/git/img_github_clone_fork_url.png)

And add that as `origin`:

### Example

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```

**Note:** According to Git naming conventions, it is recommended to name your own repository `origin`, and the one you forked for `upstream`

Now we have 2 remotes:

- `origin` - our own `fork`, where we have read and write access
- `upstream ` - the original, where we have read-only access

Now we are going to make some changes to the code. In the next chapter, we will cover how we suggest those changes to the original repository.
