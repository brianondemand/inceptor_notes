**Hoisting** means JavaScript **"lifts" declarations to the top"** of the code **before it runs**.

But â€” **only the declarations** are hoisted, **not the actual values or initializations**.

## How Hoisting Works

#### Function Declarations

Function declarations are completely hoisted, meaning both the declaration and definition are moved to the top:

```javascript
// This works even though the function is called before it's declared
sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

#### Variable Declarations

For variables, only the declarations are hoisted, not their assignments:

```javascript
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined (not an error!)
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // Outputs: 10

// The above code behaves as if it were written like this:
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10
```

### Important Distinctions

#### `let` and `const` (ES6)

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError (this is called the "Temporal Dead Zone"):

```javascript
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 20;

console.log(z); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
const z = 30;
```

#### Function Expressions

Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations:

```javascript
// This will cause an error
tryMe(); // TypeError: tryMe is not a function

var tryMe = function() {
  console.log("This won't work if called before declaration");
};

// The above behaves like:
var tryMe; // hoisted declaration (initialized as undefined)
tryMe(); // Error: trying to call undefined
tryMe = function() { ... }; // assignment happens here
```

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions, being a form of function expression, follow the same hoisting rules as function expressions:

```javascript
greet(); // TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello from arrow function");
};
```

## Best Practices

To avoid confusion and potential bugs caused by hoisting:

1. Always declare variables at the top of their scope
2. Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` to make temporal dead zone errors explicit
3. Declare functions before you call them
4. Understand how hoisting affects different declarations in JavaScript

Hoisting is an important concept to understand for debugging and writing predictable JavaScript code.
