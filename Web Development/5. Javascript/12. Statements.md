In JavaScript, a **statement** is a single line of code that performs a specific action. It represents a command for the program to execute. Statements in JavaScript can be categorized into several types, including expression statements, declaration statements, and control flow statements.

### 1. Expression Statements

- An **expression** is anything that produces a value.
- **Expression statements** perform an action based on expressions like assignments, function calls, or operations.

**Example:**

 ```javascript
   let x = 5;    // Assignment expression
  console.log(x); // Function call expression
  ```

---
### 2. Declaration Statements

- **Declaration statements** are used to declare variables, functions, or classes.
- Common declaration statements include `let`, `const`, `var`, `function`, and `class`.

**Examples:**

  ```javascript
   let age = 30;        // Declaring a variable
   const name = "John"; // Declaring a constant
   function greet() {   // Declaring a function
   console.log("Hello!");
   }
   ```

---
## 3. Control Flow Statements


Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program.

#### if/else statements

The `if` statement evaluates a condition inside parentheses. If the condition is `true`, the code block that follows is executed. If the condition is `false` and an `else` clause exists, the code in the `else` block runs instead.

```javascript
let temperature = 75;

if (temperature > 80) {
  console.log("It's hot outside!");
} else {
  console.log("The weather is pleasant.");
}
// Output: "The weather is pleasant."
```

The condition can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean. JavaScript automatically converts non-boolean values to booleans (`0`, `null`, `undefined`, `""`, `NaN` become `false`; all other values become `true`).

#### else if statements

When you need to check multiple conditions in sequence, `else if` provides a way to chain conditions. JavaScript checks each condition in order and executes the first matching block.

```javascript
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}
// Output: "Grade: B"
```

Once a condition evaluates to `true`, its code block runs and the rest of the conditions are skipped.

#### switch statements

The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and matches its value against multiple `case` clauses. It's particularly useful when comparing a single value against many possible values.

```javascript
let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = "Friday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Weekend";
}
// dayName is "Wednesday"
```

The `break` statement is crucial - without it, execution "falls through" to the next case. This can sometimes be useful for cases that share the same code, but usually indicates a mistake.

#### Ternary operator

This provides a compact syntax for simple if/else decisions. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions depending on whether the condition is true or false.

```javascript
let age = 20;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
// canVote is "Yes"
```

This is equivalent to:

```javascript
let canVote;
if (age >= 18) {
  canVote = "Yes";
} else {
  canVote = "No";
}
```

The ternary operator can be nested, but doing so often hurts readability.

### 2. Loop Statements

#### for loop

The `for` loop repeats code a specific number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization (runs once at the start), condition (checked before each iteration), and the final expression (runs after each iteration).

**A `for` loop** is used when you **know how many times** you want to repeat code.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Outputs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

The loop initializes `i` to 0, continues as long as `i < 5`, and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

#### while loop

The `while` loop repeats as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

**A `while` loop** is used when you **don't know exactly how many times** to repeat â€” you keep going **as long as a condition is true**.

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
// Outputs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

If the condition is initially `false`, the loop body never executes.

#### do-while loop

Similar to `while`, but the `do-while` loop checks the condition after executing the loop body, ensuring the code runs at least once.

Just like `while`, but it **runs at least once**, even if the condition is false.

```javascript
let count = 0;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count < 5);
// Outputs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

Even if the condition is initially false, the loop body executes once before the condition is checked.

#### for...of loop

Introduced in ES6, the `for...of` loop iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and other collection-like objects.

Just like `while`, but it **runs at least once**, even if the condition is false.

```javascript
 const person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "New York"
    };

    for (let key in person) {
      console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
    }


    // Output:
    // name: John
    // age: 30
    // city: New York
```

This loop provides a cleaner syntax for iterating over array elements compared to traditional `for` loops.

#### for...in loop

The `for...in` loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object. It's designed for objects rather than arrays.

Use it to loop through **object properties** (keys).

```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, job: "developer" };
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
// Outputs: "name: John", "age: 30", "job: developer"
```

When used with arrays, it iterates over indices as strings, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the array has additional properties.

### 3. Jump Statements

#### break

The `break` statement terminates the current loop or `switch` statement and transfers control to the statement following the terminated statement.

```javascript
let toppings = ["cheese", "pepperoni", "pineapple", "mushrooms"];

for (let i = 0; i < toppings.length; i++) {
  if (toppings[i] === "pineapple") {
    console.log("Found pineapple! Skipping the rest.");
    break;
  }
  console.log(`Checking: ${toppings[i]}`);
}

```

In this example, the loop stops when `i` reaches 5.

#### continue

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Outputs: 0, 1, 3, 4
```

In this example, the number 2 is skipped in the output.

#### return

The `return` statement exits the current function and optionally returns a value to the caller.

```javascript
function isEven(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
console.log(isEven(4)); // Outputs: true
```

Once a `return` statement executes, the function immediately terminates, and no subsequent code in the function is executed.

#### throw

The `throw` statement generates an exception that can be caught by `try...catch` statements. It's used for error handling.

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed");
  }
  return a / b;
}
```

When an exception is thrown, normal program execution is interrupted.

### 4. Exception Handling

The `try...catch...finally` statement provides a way to handle runtime errors gracefully.

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might cause an error
  let result = divide(10, 0);
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
  // This code always runs, regardless of whether an error occurred
  console.log("Operation attempted");
}
```

- The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception.
- The `catch` block executes if an exception occurs in the try block.
- The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred, making it ideal for cleanup operations.
