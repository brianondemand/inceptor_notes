JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
#### Why Study JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

JavaScript is used in millions of Web pages to add functionality, validate forms, detect browsers, and much more.

JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the Internet, and works in all major browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.

- JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages

- JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages

- JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary compilation)

**Java** and **JavaScript** are two completely different languages in both concept and design.

Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming language - in the same category as C and C++.


#### What can a JavaScript Do

**JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool** - HTML authors are normally not
programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone can
put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages

**JavaScript can put dynamic text into an HTML page** - A JavaScript statement like this below can write a variable text into an HTML page.

```javascript
document.write(<h1> + name + </h1>)
```

**JavaScript can react to events** - A JavaScript can be set to execute when something happens,
like when a page has finished loading or when a user clicks on an HTML element.

**JavaScript can read and write HTML elements** - A JavaScript can read and change the content
of an HTML element.

**JavaScript can be used to validate data** - A JavaScript can be used to validate form data before
it is submitted to a server. This saves the server from extra processing.

**JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser** - A JavaScript can be used to detect the
visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser - load another page specifically designed for that browser.

**JavaScript can be used to create cookies** - A JavaScript can be used to store and retrieve
information on the visitor's computer.
