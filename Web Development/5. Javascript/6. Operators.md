JavaScript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.

## Arithmetic Operators

The `operator =` is used to assign values.

The `operator +` is used to add values.

```javascript
y=5;
z=2;
x=y+z;
```

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`+`**      | Addition: Adds two operands.                                         |
| **`-`**      | Subtraction: Subtracts the second operand from the first.            |
| **`*`**      | Multiplication: Multiplies two operands.                             |
| **`/`**      | Division: Divides the first operand by the second.                   |
| **`%`**      | Modulus (Remainder): Returns the remainder of the division.          |
| `**`         | Exponentiation: Raises the first operand to the power of the second. |
| **`++`**     | Increment: Increases the value of an operand by `1`.                 |
| **`--`**     | Decrement: Decreases the value of an operand by `1`.                 |

## Assignment Operators

These operators allow you to perform operations on variables and assign the result back to the same variable. It’s a shorthand way to do calculations directly on variables!

```javascript
let x = 5;
x += 2;  // x = x + 2 → x becomes 7
x -= 3;  // x = x - 3 → x becomes 4
x *= 2;  // x = x * 2 → x becomes 8
x /= 4;  // x = x / 4 → x becomes 2
x %= 3;  // x = x % 3 → x becomes 2

```

|**Operator**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**`=`**|Simple Assignment: Assigns the right-hand operand to the left-hand variable.|
|**`+=`**|Addition Assignment: Adds the right-hand operand to the left-hand variable and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`-=`**|Subtraction Assignment: Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand variable and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`*=`**|Multiplication Assignment: Multiplies the left-hand variable by the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`/=`**|Division Assignment: Divides the left-hand variable by the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`%=`**|Modulus Assignment: Applies the modulus (remainder) of the division of the left-hand variable by the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`**=`**|Exponentiation Assignment: Raises the left-hand variable to the power of the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`&=`**|Bitwise AND Assignment: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`|=`**|
|**`^=`**|Bitwise XOR Assignment: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`<<=`**|Bitwise Left Shift Assignment: Shifts the left-hand variable’s bits to the left by the number of bits specified by the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`>>=`**|Bitwise Right Shift Assignment: Shifts the left-hand variable’s bits to the right by the number of bits specified by the right-hand operand and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|
|**`>>>`**|Bitwise Zero Fill Right Shift Assignment: Shifts the left-hand variable’s bits to the right while filling zeros from the left side and assigns the result to the left-hand variable.|

The rule is:

- If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string.

- JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators.

- Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.



## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                                           | **Example** | **Result** |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **`==`**     | Equal to: Checks if two values are equal (ignores type).                                  | `5 == '5'`  | `true`     |
| **`===`**    | Strict equal to: Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.                     | `5 === '5'` | `false`    |
| **`!=`**     | Not equal to: Checks if two values are not equal (ignores type).                          | `5 != '5'`  | `false`    |
| **`!==`**    | Strict not equal to: Checks if two values are not equal or of different types.            | `5 !== '5'` | `true`     |
| **`>`**      | Greater than: Checks if the left value is greater than the right.                         | `10 > 5`    | `true`     |
| **`<`**      | Less than: Checks if the left value is less than the right.                               | `10 < 5`    | `false`    |
| **`>=`**     | Greater than or equal to: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right. | `10 >= 5`   | `true`     |
| **`<=`**     | Less than or equal to: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.       | `10 <= 5`   | `false`    |


```javascript
console.log(5 == '5');    // true
console.log(5 === '5');   // false
console.log(10 > 5);      // true
console.log(10 < 5);      // false
console.log(10 >= 5);     // true
console.log(10 <= 5);     // false
```

Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result:

```javascript
if (age<18) document.write("Too young");
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| **Operator** | **Description**                                         | **Example**     | **Result**                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`&&`**     | Logical AND: Returns `true` if both operands are true.  | `true && false` | `false`                                                     |
| \|\|         |                                                         | \|\|            | Logical OR: Returns `true` if at least one operand is true. |
| **`!`**      | Logical NOT: Reverses the boolean value of its operand. | `!true`         | `false`                                                     |


```javascript
console.log(true && false);   // false
console.log(true || false);   // true
console.log(!true);           // false
```



## Conditional Operator

JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                                                                    | **Example**                            | **Result** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **`? :`**    | Conditional (Ternary) Operator: Returns one value if the condition is true, and another if the condition is false. | `let result = (5 > 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No';` | `'Yes'`    |


```javascript
let result = (5 > 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // result will be 'Yes'
console.log(result);  // Output: Yes

let result2 = (5 < 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // result2 will be 'No'
console.log(result2); // Output: No
```
