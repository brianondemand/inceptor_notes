### How does a computer program work

A program makes a computer usable. Without a program, a computer, even the most powerful one, is nothing more than an object.

A **computer needs instructions** (called a **program**) to do anything. Without them, it's just a lifeless machine—like a **piano** that needs a **player** to make music.

Computers are fast, but not smart on their own.

They can only do simple things, like adding or dividing numbers.

What makes them powerful is that they can do these simple things **millions of times per second**.

Computers don’t understand English. So we write programs in special **programming languages** (like Python) that **translate our ideas** into something the computer can follow.

> A computer is like a super-fast worker that can only follow very basic instructions. A **program** is the list of those instructions. Without programs, computers can't do anything useful.


Computers **have their own language** called **machine language**, but it’s **very basic** and not like human language at all.

It’s a list of very **simple instructions** that a computer can understand directly, like:

- “Add these numbers.”

- “Divide this number.”

- “Save the result.”

Every computer has a list of commands it can understand. This is called an Instruction List (IL).

Different computers can have different ILs, with different sets of commands.

Just like some people speak English and others speak Chinese, computers speak different machine languages depending on their type.

Note: machine languages are developed by humans.

No computer is currently capable of creating a new language. However, that may change soon. But in the future, **AI might help create new ones**.


### What makes a language

Every **language**—whether it’s a **human language** (like English) or a **computer language** (like Python or machine code)—has **four basic parts** that make it work.

### 1. Alphabet 

This is the **set of symbols** a language uses to form words.

- **English** uses the **Latin alphabet**: A, B, C, ..., Z.

- **Computer languages** use things like letters, numbers, and special characters: `a`, `5`, `+`, `=`, `{`, etc.

Think of it as the “**building blocks**” of words.

### 2. Lexis (Vocabulary) 

This is the **set of words** a language allows.

- "computer" is a real English word.

- "cmoptrue" is just gibberish—it’s **not in the dictionary**.

- Some words exist in more than one language, like "chat" in English and French, but they can mean **different things**.


The **dictionary** of the language.

---

### 3. Syntax 

This is the **set of rules** for how to **arrange words** into sentences.

- "I am a python" = correct syntax

- "I a python am" = incorrect syntax (in English)

- In coding: `print("Hello")` is correct syntax in Python. `print("Hello"` is not.


Syntax tells us **what order words or symbols** must be in to make sense **grammatically**.

---

### 4. Semantics 

This is about **meaning**—does the sentence **make sense**?

- "I ate a doughnut" = good semantics (it means something logical).

- "A doughnut ate me" = bad semantics (unless it's a cartoon!).


Even if the **words are in the right order**, the sentence still needs to **mean something**.
