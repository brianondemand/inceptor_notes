**pwcache refers to a mechanism, often implemented as a library or set of functions, for caching user and group information retrieved from the system's password and group databases (like /etc/passwd and /etc/group). This caching improves performance by reducing the number of calls to functions like getpwnam and getgrnam, which can be slow.** 


```bash
find . -name *.log -mtime -1
```

- find: search for files & directories
- `.` : start from wherever you currently are
- `-name "*.log"` : look for files whose names end with `.log`
- `*`: wildcard meaning any characters
- `-mtime`: modification time (in days)
- `-1`: means less than 1 day ago(modified within the last 24 hours)
