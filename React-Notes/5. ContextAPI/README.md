# Context API 🌍
Welcome to the Context API! 🎉 If you’ve ever struggled with prop drilling in your React apps, you’re in the right place. The Context API provides a way to share values across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It’s a lifesaver for managing global state!

## What Is the Context API? 🤔
