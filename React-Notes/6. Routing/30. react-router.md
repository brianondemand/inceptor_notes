# React Router: Navigating Your App 🌐

Welcome to the world of React Router! 🚀 Discover how to set up and use React Router to navigate between components seamlessly in your React applications.

## What is React Router?

React Router is a powerful library that enables you to manage navigation within your React app. It allows you to define routes and render different components based on the current URL, creating a smooth single-page application experience.

## Getting Started with React Router

To start using React Router, you first need to install it:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

## Basic Setup

1. **Create a Router:**

   Use `createBrowserRouter` to define your application routes. This is where you map paths to their corresponding components.

2. **Wrap Your App:**

   Use `RouterProvider` to make routing available throughout your application.

3. **Navigation:**

   Utilize the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes without refreshing the page. This keeps the user experience fluid and fast.
