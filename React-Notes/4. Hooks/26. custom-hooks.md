# Custom Hooks: Reusable Logic in React ðŸ”„

Welcome back! Today, weâ€™re diving into **Custom Hooks**, a powerful feature in React that allows you to extract and reuse stateful logic across your components. This helps keep your code organized and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).


# What Are Custom Hooks?

Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names start with "use" and can call other hooks. They enable you to encapsulate logic that can be shared among different components. This means you can manage state, side effects, or even handle forms in a reusable way!

**Mia:** "So, Leo, how do custom hooks help me?"

**Leo:** "Great question! Custom hooks let you bundle logic that can be reused in different components, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain!" ðŸŒŸ


# Creating a Custom Hook

Letâ€™s create a simple custom hook for managing a counter.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

// Custom hook for counter logic
const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
};

export default useCounter;
```


# Using the Custom Hook

Now, letâ€™s see how to use this custom hook in a component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import useCounter from './useCounter';

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

# Explanation

- **Custom Hook (useCounter):** This hook encapsulates the logic for managing the counter state, including the increment and decrement functions.

- **Using the Hook:** In the `CounterComponent`, we simply call `useCounter` to get the current count and the functions to update it.

**Mia:** "So I can create hooks for different functionalities and just use them wherever I need?"

**Leo:** "Exactly! It promotes code reuse and keeps your components focused on their specific role." ðŸš€


# When to Use Custom Hooks

1. **Repetitive Logic:** When you find yourself repeating the same logic in multiple components, itâ€™s time to create a custom hook.

2. **Organizing Code:** Custom hooks help keep your component files clean by moving logic out of the component.


# Fun Fact! ðŸŽ‰

Did you know that custom hooks can also use other hooks within them? This allows for even more powerful combinations and reusability in your application!
