![](https://i.imgur.com/4FnuOsr.png)

- Now **Double-click** on the **SQL Service** and on the description input **The password is MYpassword123#**, The reason why we are doing this is because this is a vulnerable lab and again some some users still do this thinking they are the only one that can see the description, meanwhile every valid user can :)

Now type in this command on the terminal

```cmd
setspn -a HYDRA-DC/SQLService.MARVEL.local:60111 HYDRA-DC\SQLService
```

What we are doing here is setting a port for the **SQLService**

![](https://i.imgur.com/oRmJ2ij.png)

we can also use the command `setspn -T MARVEL.local -Q */*` to make sure it was properly configured, Note that SPN stands for **Service Principle Name**

The Next thing to do is to set up a group policy, It a policy that will be pushed for the entire domain, Navigate to your search bar and search with keyword **group** and click on the first result
