#### Understanding the `/etc/passwd` File

The `/etc/passwd` file is a fundamental configuration file in Linux that stores essential information about user accounts. Each line in the file corresponds to a single user on the system. The format of each entry follows a colon-separated structure like so:

```
username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell
```

The first field is the username. 

The second field, typically shown as an `x`, means that the actual password is stored securely in the `/etc/shadow` file, not here. 

The third and fourth fields are numeric values representing the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). The UID uniquely identifies each user, while the GID represents their primary group. 

he fifth field is optional and used for user description or full name. 

The sixth field indicates the user's home directory (e.g., `/home/username`), and the last field specifies the default shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`) that the user is assigned upon login.


**Types of Users:**

| Type              | UID Range (Typical) | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Users**  | 1–999               | Run background services (e.g. `mysql`, `www-data`) |
| **Regular Users** | 1000+               | Created by you or by apps for login use            |
| **Root User**     | 0                   | Superuser                                          |

The `x` in the second field of each line **does not represent the actual password**.

Instead, it means: "The **encrypted password** is stored in `/etc/shadow`, not here."

- Originally, `/etc/passwd` used to store hashed passwords in this field.
    
- But since `/etc/passwd` is **world-readable** (anyone can view it), storing password hashes there became a security risk.
    
- Now, most modern Linux systems store password hashes in `/etc/shadow`, which is **only readable by root**.

**How to See Only View Created Users Only:**

```bash
awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $1 != "nobody" { print $1 }' /etc/passwd
```

- This lists users with UID ≥ 1000, which are usually **real login users**.


Most of Users can’t log in:

They have their shell set to `/usr/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false`, which prevents login.

#### Understanding the `/etc/shadow` File

The `/etc/shadow` file is used for storing encrypted password information and additional password-related settings for users. Each line represents a user and contains several fields separated by colons. 

The second field contains the encrypted password. If the field starts with `$`, it indicates the hashing algorithm used. 

For example, `$6$` refers to SHA-512 hashing, while `$y$` indicates the use of Yescrypt, which is commonly used in newer Linux distributions like Kali.

The remaining fields specify password aging information such as the number of days since the last password change, the minimum and maximum days between password changes, and warning/inactive/expiration periods. 

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`$6$...`|Encrypted password using SHA-512 (the `$6$` indicates SHA-512)|
|`!`|Account is **locked** (no login allowed)|
|`*`|Password **not set** or **account disabled** (often system users)|
|blank (`""`)|No password required (insecure)|

**Example:**

```
johndoe:$6$sK3j8...:19407:0:99999:7:::
```

- **`johndoe`** – username
    
- **`$6$...`** – hashed password using SHA-512
    
- **`19407`** – password last changed on day 19407 since Jan 1, 1970
    
- **`0`** – can change password anytime
    
- **`99999`** – password expires after ~273 years (never)
    
- **`7`** – start warning 7 days before password expires
    
- **`:::`** – inactive/expire/reserved fields are unset


**Only the root user can read this file, which enhances security by protecting sensitive password hashes.**

| Prefix | Algorithm                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `$1$`  | MD5                           |
| `$2y$` | bcrypt (used in some systems) |
| `$5$`  | SHA-256                       |
| `$6$`  | SHA-512                       |

**Converting 20195 to a Human Date**

To convert that to a real-world date, you can use this command:

```bash
date -d '1970-01-01 +20195 days'
```

#### The `/etc/sudoers` File and Sudo Access

The `/etc/sudoers` file controls which users or groups can execute commands with superuser privileges using the `sudo` command. 

This file must be edited with caution using the `visudo` command, which checks for syntax errors to prevent system misconfigurations. In the file, you may see sections like `# User privilege specification`, under which you can grant users permission to run `sudo`.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

- Edit sudoers file.

**NEVER edit `/etc/sudoers` directly** without using the `visudo` command. This ensures syntax checks are done to prevent configuration errors, which could lock you out of `sudo`.

**Basic Format:**

A typical line in the `sudoers` file looks like this:

```
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

**username  hostname=(runas_user) command**

- `username` — the user granted `sudo` privileges.
    
- `hostname` — the machine or host where the rule applies (usually set to `ALL`).
    
- `runas_user` — the user that the command is run as (often `root`).
    
- `command` — the specific command(s) that the user is allowed to run.

This grants the specified user full `sudo` access. It’s also possible to add users to the `sudo` group and manage access through group-based rules.

**`sudoers` includes additional configuration files**, often located in `/etc/sudoers.d/`, which allows for modular management of sudo permissions.

#### Disabling `sudo` Access

If you want to prevent all users from using the `sudo` command, you can remove them from the `sudo` group or delete any individual rules in `/etc/sudoers` that grant them access. 

1. **Removing a user from the `sudo` group can be done using:**

```bash
sudo deluser username sudo
```

Once removed, the user will no longer be able to run commands with elevated privileges.

2. **Remove or comment out all existing `sudo` access rules** for other users and groups. This includes lines like:

```bash
#%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#%admin  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#username ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

- You can comment them out by adding `#` in front of these lines, so they don't have sudo privileges.

3. **Lock Down Sudo Access via sudoers.d** 

You can also manage sudo access in a more modular way by editing the sudoers file inside the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory. 

This keeps the main sudoers file cleaner and makes the management of user permissions easier.

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/nosudouser
```

- Remove other users' sudo privileges by adding entries for them in /etc/sudoers.d/:
- In that file, you can disable them by adding:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/false
```

#### Allowing Only One User to Use `sudo`

To ensure that only one user has `sudo` access, you must remove all others from the `sudo` group and from any relevant entries in the `/etc/sudoers` file. Then, you add the desired user to the `sudo` group using:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```

This ensures that only this user has administrative privileges.

**# User Privilege Specification:**

This section is typically where you **explicitly specify which users or groups** are allowed to use `sudo` and which commands they can run. If you want to give a **specific user** (`adminuser`) access to `sudo`, this is where you would add them.

**# Allow Members of Group sudo to Execute Any Command:**

This section controls **group-based access**. If you want to allow all members of a group (e.g., `sudo` group) to have `sudo` access, you would use this section.


#### Example of the /etc/sudoers file after modification:

```bash
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
adminuser  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
# %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL   # Commented out to disable sudo for group members

# Same for other groups like admin
# %admin  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL   # Commented out

```


- **`root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`**: This is typically present and ensures the root user has full sudo access.

- **`adminuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`**: Explicitly grants `adminuser` full sudo access.

- **Commented-out group entries** (`%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`, `%admin ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`): These lines have been disabled to **remove sudo access** from those groups.



##### Configuring the Password Prompt when using sudo

If you want to **modify or remove** the password prompt (though not recommended for security reasons), you can adjust the `sudoers` file:

1. **To avoid password prompts for specific commands**:  
    You can configure `sudo` to not ask for a password for specific commands by editing the `/etc/sudoers` file.

```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```

This allows `username` to execute the specified command without being prompted for a password.

2. **To avoid the password prompt for all `sudo` commands**:  


```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This grants `username` the ability to execute **any** command with `sudo` without being asked for a password, though this is highly discouraged for security reasons.
