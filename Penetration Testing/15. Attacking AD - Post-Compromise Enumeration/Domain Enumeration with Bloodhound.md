```powershell
# Crate a directory called bloodhound and switch to it
$ mkdir bloodhound
$ cd bloodhound

# Data collection process with bloodhound-python 
# -d : the Domain
# -u : specific user on the domain
# -p : password for the specific user for the domain we specified
# -ns : the specific IP for you name server which is the domain controller
# -c : collect all data
$ sudo bloodhound-python -d MARVEL.local -u fcastle -p Password1 -ns 192.168.0.149 -c all
