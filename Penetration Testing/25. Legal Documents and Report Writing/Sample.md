## üìù ABSTRACT

This project investigates prevalent web application vulnerabilities and demonstrates practical mitigation strategies. Through simulated attacks using tools like SQLMap and Burp Suite, the project tests how input validation, authentication, and proper configuration contribute to secure application deployment. The results confirm that a layered security approach significantly reduces risk exposure. The report concludes with recommendations for developers and organizations to integrate security throughout the development lifecycle.

## üìñ CHAPTER ONE: PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Background

Web applications are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals due to poor security practices and misconfigurations. Ensuring security by design is now essential.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Many developers overlook basic security controls, exposing applications to threats like SQL Injection, XSS, and broken authentication.

### 1.3 Objectives

**General Objective:**  
To identify and mitigate common vulnerabilities in web applications.  
**Specific Objectives:**

- To simulate common web attacks
    
- To test and validate protection mechanisms
    
- To document findings and recommendations
    

### 1.4 Research Questions

- What are the most common attack vectors targeting web apps?
    
- Which techniques are most effective in preventing these attacks?
    

### 1.5 Significance of the Study

This research helps developers and businesses understand and implement key security measures, reducing risk exposure.

### 1.6 Scope and Limitations

The project focuses on client-server web applications. It does not cover mobile or desktop application vulnerabilities.

Topics reviewed include:

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
    
- Role of firewalls and WAFs
    
- Importance of secure coding practices
    
- Related studies on penetration testing and ethical hacking

## üß™ CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Research Design

An experimental approach using black-box testing techniques.

### 3.2 Tools and Technologies

- Burp Suite
    
- SQLMap
    
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
    
- Kali Linux
    

### 3.3 Data Collection

Information was gathered by performing test attacks and logging the system responses.

### 3.4 Procedure

1. Setup vulnerable web app environment (DVWA)
    
2. Perform SQLi and XSS attacks
    
3. Apply security measures (e.g., input validation, CSP headers)
    
4. Re-test and analyze effectiveness
    

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CHAPTER FOUR: IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

### 4.1 System Setup

DVWA hosted on Apache server within Kali Linux VM.

### 4.2 Attack Simulation

Using SQLMap and Burp Suite, vulnerabilities were exploited successfully before applying controls.

### 4.3 Countermeasures Applied

- Parameterized queries
    
- Output encoding
    
- CSP headers
    

### 4.4 Results

After applying mitigation, simulated attacks were blocked or failed, showing reduced vulnerability.

|Attack Type|Status Before|Status After|
|---|---|---|
|SQLi|Successful|Blocked|
|XSS|Successful|Blocked|

## üßæ CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION

### 5.1 Summary

This project demonstrated that web applications are highly vulnerable without proper input validation and configuration.

### 5.2 Findings

- SQLi and XSS were exploitable without protections
    
- Parameterized queries and CSP mitigated attacks
    
- Regular testing is necessary
    

### 5.3 Recommendations

- Use secure coding practices
    
- Employ automated security testing tools
    
- Train developers on OWASP Top 10
    

### 5.4 Future Work

Expand testing to mobile apps and real-world APIs.
