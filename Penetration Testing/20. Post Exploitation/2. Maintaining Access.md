If something where to happen to the current session we are in, on a particular machine, Maintaining Access typically means we have a way of gaining access back to that machine.


- [ ] Add a User

Let say for example we do have a **Powershell** or **MS-DOS** shell on our targets system, we can use this command to create persistence, whereby creating a user `hacker` and password `password123`

```powershell
$ net user hacker password123 /add
```

> Best for a Penetration Testing scenario
### **Metasploit**

**Caution :** You shouldn't run this on a pentest, Except if you have solid reasons for doing so

- **Persistence Scripts**
	- run persistence -h
	- exploit/windows/local/persistence
	- exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence

> This will open a port on the target system for us which can be dangerous

- **Scheduled Tasks**
	- run scheduleme
	- run schtaskabause

> This will schedule a task to run every mins/sec/hrs, just like a cron job, no matter how many times the system reboots, once the time reaches, our scheduled task will run, this is quite dangerous too
