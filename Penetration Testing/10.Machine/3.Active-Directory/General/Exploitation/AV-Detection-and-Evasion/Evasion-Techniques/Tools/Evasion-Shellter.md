# Shellter

automated mode (a)
Home/.../Something.exe                ---> The exe (32bits) we want to 
Stealth Mode     -> Y
Listed Payload   -> L                 ---> Select a payload shell

# Attacking Machine
Set a lisenner or Meterpreter

# Target Machine
Launch the payload
```

- You need an executable to use shllter (a file witch will be used to exploit the other machine)
- Original file is in backups

- Take note that the shell session will be close after the user close the window of the installed exe. To solve this you need to migrate to an other processes
	- If you use multihandler in your shellter shell use the following to automaticly migrate the process: set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate

## What is Shelter

Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool aka dynamic PE infector. It can
be used in order to inject shellcode into native Windows applications
(currently 32-bit apps only). The shellcode can be something yours or something
generated through a framework, such as Metasploit.

Shellter takes advantage of the original structure of the PE file and doesn't
apply any  modification such as changing memory access permissions in sections
(unless the user wants to), adding an extra section with RWE access, and
whatever would look dodgy under an AV scan.

Shellter is not just an EPO infector that tries to find a location to insert an
instruction to redirect execution to the payload. Unlike any other infector,
Shellterâ€™s advanced infection engine never transfers the execution flow to a
code cave or to an added section in the infected PE file.
