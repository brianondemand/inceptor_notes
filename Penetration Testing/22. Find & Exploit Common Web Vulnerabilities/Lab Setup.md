**We need to download this file first :** [https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/CbIyLkOuS4GUH7TNFTFg](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/CbIyLkOuS4GUH7TNFTFg)


**We need to setup our own lab on docker in other to run attacks on a safe environment ðŸ¤Ÿ**

```bash
$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade

$ sudo apt install docker.io

$ sudo apt install docker-compose
```

**RESTART YOUR VM**

Copy the labs to a directory in your system, then open a terminal to that directory

```shell
$ tar -xf peh-web-labs.tar.gz

$ cd labs

$ sudo docker-compose up
```


> The first time it runs, it will need to download some things, it may take a while depending on your internet connection. Next time you run it though, it will be much faster.

Once you see the databases are **ready for connections** the containers should be ready to go.

The final step is to set some permissions for the **webserver**, this is needed for the file upload labs and the capstone challenge. Open up a new terminal window in the `labs` directory and do this :


```shell
$ ./set-permissions.sh
```

Browse toÂ **http://localhost**


> The first time you load the lab the database will need to be initialized, just follow the instructions in the red box by clicking the link, then coming back to the homepage.



- [ ] We can check for what containers are running with

```bash
$ sudo docker ps -a
```

- [ ] We can stop all active containers with

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose stop
```

- [ ] We can remove docker containers with 

```bash
# automatically remove all docker containers
$ sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)

# Remove docker containers manually
# You need to run <$ sudo docker ps -a> to note the CONTAINER-ID
$ sudo docker rm <CONTAINER-ID>
```


### **TROUBLE SHOOTING**

If you have any problem with the labs we can just navigate to **http://localhost//init.php** and this will reset everything for us :D
