We have an upload function on the website given

Trying to upload any other file than **JPG** and **PNG** we get this message

We can then use burpsuite to intercept the request and see if there are any checks, Try uploading a PNG file then intercept the request

Now, let try uploading a PHP cmd file, scrape out the image file data and rename the file to anything.php, Forward your request and you should see that the file has been uploaded.

## **Fuzzing**

A good act is to always fuzz for where this file is located at using `FFUF`

```bash
$ ffuf -ic -u "http://localhost/FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -fc 404,403,401 -fs 4431 -e .txt,.php,.bak,.sql
```

We can see that `labs` is the only one that stands out and here and here is why, our current directory is `labs` then
`f0x01.php` which indicate that their must be other files/directories in this folder

Fuzzing on the labs directory we have

```bash
$ ffuf -ic -u "http://localhost/labs/FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -fc 404,403,401 -fs 4431 -e .txt,.php,.bak,.sql
```
