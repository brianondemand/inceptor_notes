We are given a web page in which we can add items to a particular list on the browser

Checking the Network tab on our inspector we can see that no actual request is made to any resource outside the local ones.

So then definitely XSS payloads like - `<script>prompt(1)</script>` won't work instead would just be stored as an item and won't be triggered

As we can see by **inspecting-elements** it shows `<script>prompt(1)</script>` as an item

With this payload - `"><img src=/ onerror="prompt(1)">` - we where able to get a trigger
