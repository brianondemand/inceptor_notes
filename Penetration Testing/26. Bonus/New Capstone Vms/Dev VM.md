As usual login with `root:tcm` , do `dhclient` and then `ip a` to get ip address of the target

Connect to target via SSH  to make things easier

Now let start attacking to get root , run your nmap scan with the below command 

```sh

We have port 80/HTTP opened, checking it out looks like we've another default web page 

![](https://i.imgur.com/p9KMlEI.png)

Running Directory Bruteforce with `ffuf` we have 6 entries found, let check them out

![](https://i.imgur.com/1acxDub.png)


`/public` is a 301 that leads to a page we don't have access to , `/index.php` takes us back to the default page, down from `/src` to `/extensions` is just an index page , also there is information disclosure of `Apache/2.4.38 (Debian) Server`

Nice soo, let enumerate vulnerabilities for versions of frameworks used on the website , which i don't seem to find anything interesting, remember we also have port 8080/HTTP running, which is a default `phpinfo` page 

![](https://i.imgur.com/uS8i01U.png)

However enumerating the PHP version doesn't seem to be giving, so i did directory Brute force and found 2 entries , `/index.php` takes us back to the default page but `/dev` gives us a successfully installed page of the `bolt` default page that was wrongly configured on port 80/HTTP

I found a local file inclusion vulnerability but i need to be logged in first , you can read about it from [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48411)

![](https://i.imgur.com/EBWrH6W.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/V16NJhZ.png)

So i decided to create an account and then try it out, the vulnerability existed, **local file inclusion**

![](https://i.imgur.com/UXrqKeV.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/GnVctnu.png)

The user `/home/jeanpaul` existed , but we need a way to get the password, i can't read `/etc/shadow` , but we still have one more service to enumerate which if `NFS` {Network File Sharing} , i tried out `hydra` too ðŸ˜… , but it didn't work <3

![](https://i.imgur.com/LyqCVHj.png)

Let enumerate NFS , you can read on mounting NFS shares from [here](https://jamespatricksec.medium.com/enumerating-and-exploiting-nfs-1571cb484e16) , Tried several passwords but to no avail , right here we can see we have a `note.txt` and an `id_rsa` file

![](https://i.imgur.com/lvZxlZp.png)

I then decided to bruteforce the file and came across a tool called `fcrackzip` , you can install it doing `sudo apt install fcrackzip` on your terminal and run it with `fcrackzip -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt save.zip`

![](https://i.imgur.com/42aBeL8.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/mKzkoYK.png)

Now that it is cracked , i guess we can read the information, i also guess the id_rsa key is for `jeanpaul`

![](https://i.imgur.com/65mBaJZ.png)

Trying to login, we are demanded a password key for the id_rsa, so let enumerate harder 

![](https://i.imgur.com/jJRuc9J.png)

Going to `http://192.168.0.117/app/config/config.yml` we found some credentials there saying , which definitely works when logging in to SSH with `jeanpaul` , sweet ðŸ˜˜

```yml
# If you're trying out Bolt, just keep it set to SQLite for now.
database:
    driver: sqlite
    databasename: bolt
    username: bolt
    password: I_love_java
```

## Privilege Escalation

Doing `sudo -l` tells us we can `zip` with sudo permissions

![](https://i.imgur.com/7IUf04x.png)

Checking `GTFOBINS` gives us a way we can get root using `zip`

![](https://i.imgur.com/X509mGc.png)

Hell yeah and we are root ðŸ¤ŸðŸ˜…
