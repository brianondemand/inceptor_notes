As usual start the VM and run this commands

```sh
root@blackpearl:~# dhclient
root@blackpearl:~# ip a (for target ip address)
```

Connect via SSH to make it easier to communicate with targets (Optional)

Starting out with port `80/HTTP` , we have an nginx server web page

Running Directory Brute force gives us a `/secret` page since checking `/robots.txt` doesn't seems to give us leads

![](https://i.imgur.com/NykjLj3.png)

Navigating to `/secret` we are asked to download a file, after downloading we got this message ðŸ˜‚

![](https://i.imgur.com/Yocj6XK.png)

Nice, a quick help, since we have port 53 opened let perform a zone transfer, we can add the target to our `/etc/hosts` file giving it the domain name `blackpearl.tcm`

![](https://i.imgur.com/4Muv2Zk.png)

Trying out zone transfer, Looks like every attempt failed ðŸ˜­ But navigating back to the website gives us a `phpinfo` page

![](https://i.imgur.com/7jrkrxJ.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/KM4NvgK.png)

Great !!, Then we can do a directory bruteforce once again on `blackpearl.tcm` this time, not the IP Address

![](https://i.imgur.com/cQNERGJ.png)

Definitely `/index.php` will take us back to the phpinfo page sooo, let check out `/navigate` which we are referred to a login page

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5emdP0.png)

+ I couldn't login with default Credentials
+ Checking the source code i can see the CMS version

![](https://i.imgur.com/LyQqTDI.png)

Enumerating this version gives an `# (Unauthenticated) Remote Code Execution` , i also did a directory bruteforce just to be sure on `http://blackpearl.tcm/navigate` and got alot of entries, Nothing seems to be giving good vibes except the `/login.php` 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hGci25k.png)

Going back to the `(Unauthenticated) Remote Code Execution` vulnerability, let look further into it in which you can get the exploit from [here](https://github.com/0x4r2/Navigate-CMS-RCE-Unauthenticated-), Also make sure to follow the guidelines on setting up the exploit on the page

### Privilege Escalation

as usual, i will transfer Linpeas first for further investigations ðŸ˜†

![](https://i.imgur.com/c8YrdLl.png)

- First of all we have the user `alek`

![](https://i.imgur.com/uiYfoGc.png)

- We can run `sudo -l` cos' sudo isn't installed on `www-data`
- Checking for `SUID` we have an unusual binary here which is `/usr/bin/php7.3`

![](https://i.imgur.com/QWEleiF.png)

Great `GTFOBINS` has a payload for it to escalate to root using `PHP`, Tweaking my payload to this: `/usr/bin/php7.3 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/bash', ['-p']);"`

![](https://i.imgur.com/dfwVNWV.png)

+ Then we are root, We did not need `Linpeas` ðŸ˜†, Always Enumerate first!! bankaiiii ðŸŽŽðŸ¤Ÿ
