Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.

	The example below shows what a POP3 session would look like if conducted via a Telnet client. First, the user connects to the POP3 server at the POP3 default port 110. Authentication is required to access the email messages; the user authenticates by providing his username `USER frank` and password `PASS D2xc9CgD`. Using the command `STAT`, we get the reply `+OK 1 179`; based on [RFC 1939](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1939), a positive response to `STAT` has the format `+OK nn mm`, where _nn_ is the number of email messages in the inbox, and _mm_ is the size of the inbox in octets (byte). The command `LIST` provided a list of new messages on the server, and `RETR 1` retrieved the first message in the list. We don’t need to concern ourselves with memorizing these commands; however, it is helpful to strengthen our understanding of such protocol.

	The example above shows that the commands are sent in cleartext. Using Telnet was enough to authenticate and retrieve an email message. As the username and password are sent in cleartext, any third party watching the network traffic can steal the login credentials.

## Find POP3 Port
Nmap
```
nmap -sV -SC IP -p110
```

- Possible to find POP3 on an other port

## Connection
- Telnet
```Terminal
telnet [ip] 110
```

- POP3 Commands
