
Directory enumeration is the process of obtaining a list of files and directories from a file system. This can be done using various command-line tools such as 'ls' on Linux and macOS, and 'dir' on Windows. 

Enumeration is often used by attackers to gather information about a target system during the reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack. It can also be used by system administrators to identify and manage files and directories on a file system.
