Nessus is an automated vulnerability scanner similar to the Nmap scanner, but a step further Nessus presents all the findings in a GUI. Nessus is different from any other scanners as it does not make any assumption, for example, HTTP service is running on port 80.

Nessus provides both free and paid versions, for this walkthrough free version will be used to demonstrate.

## Nessus Installation

As the first step visit the [*https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials*](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) page and get registered. The activation code will be emailed to you.

*Note — the activation code is valid for one time. if the user uninstalls the Nessus program the activation will be expired.*

Username and Password

## Create a Scan in Nessus

After the login process user will be redirected to the home page of Nessus scanning tool

- Click on **Scan** on the top navigation bar ( it will be redirected to the **My Scan** page )
- Click on the **New Scan** button in the upper right corner ( this will be redirected to the **Scan Templates** page )
- Select the Scan Template according to the user's preference.
- Configure the settings of the respective Scan Template.

After completing each step user is good to go for a scan, there are two scanning launch methods,

- **Immediate launch** — Click on the below-mentioned button and then click on the launch button.

- **Schedule Launch** — Nessus gives users an option to launch the scan later (at a scheduled time ), in order to do this click on the save button.

## Scanning Templates in Nessus

Tenable Nessus is a corporate scanning tool, that provides various templates. The scanning tool provides three main templates for scanning, Discovery, Vulnerabilities, and Compliance.

## Discovery Scanning

Nessus recommends all users conduct a host discovery to make sure what hosts are in your network. Discovery scans output information associated with IP addresses, operating systems, open ports, and FQDN. Users can then decide what host the user targets to conduct a vulnerability scan.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Widely used Nessus scan provides various vulnerability scanning templates for corporate needs in day-to-day use. In addition, Nessus facilitates organizations to scan for specific vulnerabilities or vulnerability groups. Tenable frequently updates Nessus to detect the latest vulnerabilities.

## Widely Used Vulnerability Scanning Templates in the Domain

Basic Scan — This is one of the easy and quick methods to scan assets for vulnerabilities, The basic scan template scans assets with all the plugins enabled.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*KlAxlRBY4gNGuljc.png)

Basic Network Scan

Advanced Network Scan — Advanced Network Scan is the most configurable scanning option available. This scan template can be configured to match any policy or to scan for assets. The default Advanced Network Scanning template has the same configuring options as the Basic Network Scanning Template but accommodates additional configuration options such as slow and fast check. Misconfiguration could lead to asset outages or network saturation.

Advanced Network Scan

Advanced Dynamic Scan — Advanced dynamic scan allows users to configure dynamic scan filters, instead of manually selecting plugin families or individuals. Whenever Tenable Nessus releases a new plugin, it automatically adds plugins that match the filter the scan, or the policy. This allows us to mount Nessus scans for specific vulnerabilities while ensuring that the scan stays up to date as new plugins are released.

Advanced Dynamic Scan Configuration

Credentialed Patch Audit — This specific scan type uses credentials to be directed into the host, and enumerate missing patch updates.

Credentialed Patch Audit Configuration.

## Compliance

Compliance scanning template helps organizations to check whether host configurations are compliant with various industry standards. This scan is also referred to as a **Configuration scan.**

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is ==a standard for assessing the severity of software vulnerabilities==. It provides a numerical score (0-10) based on various factors like attack vector, complexity, and impact. The higher the score, the more severe the vulnerability. CVSS is used by organizations to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts and manage risks. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

What is CVSS?

- **Standard:**
    
    CVSS is a widely adopted standard developed by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). 
    
- **Purpose:**
    
    It helps quantify the severity of vulnerabilities in software and hardware. 
    
- **Score:**
    
    CVSS assigns a numerical score (0-10) to each vulnerability, with 10 being the most severe. 
    
- **Impact:**
    
    The score is used to help organizations prioritize vulnerability remediation activities and manage risks. 
    

How it Works:

- **Metrics:** CVSS uses a set of metrics to evaluate the vulnerability, including:
    - **Attack Vector:** How easily the vulnerability can be exploited (e.g., network, local). 
    - **Attack Complexity:** How difficult it is to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., low, high). 
    - **Privileges Required:** The level of access needed to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., none, low, high). 
    - **User Interaction:** Whether the victim needs to interact with the vulnerability for it to be exploited. 
    - **Scope:** Whether the vulnerability affects the entire system or only parts of it. 
    - **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact of the vulnerability on these aspects. 
- **Calculation:** These metrics are combined using a formula to generate the CVSS score. 

Importance of CVSS:

- **Prioritization:**
    
    Helps organizations prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts by identifying the most critical vulnerabilities.
    
- **Risk Management:**
    
    Allows organizations to assess and manage the risks associated with vulnerabilities.
    
- **Communication:**
    
    Provides a common language for communicating the severity of vulnerabilities to stakeholders.
    
- **Vulnerability Management Programs:**
    
    A key component of vulnerability management programs.
    
- **Third-Party Tool Integration:**
    
    Many cybersecurity tools integrate with CVSS scores for vulnerability management.
