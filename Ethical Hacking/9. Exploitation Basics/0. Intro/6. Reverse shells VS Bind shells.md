A **reverse shell** or connect-back is a setup, where the attacker must first start the server on his machine, while the target machine will have to act as a client that connects to the server served by the attacker

A **bind shell** is a sort of setup where remote consoles are established with other computers over the network. In Bind shell, an attacker launches a service on the target computer, to which the attacker can connect.


|S.NO.|Bind Shell|Reverse Shell|
|---|---|---|
|1.|Bind Shells have the listener running on the target and the attacker connects to the listener in order to gain remote access to the target system.|In the reverse shell, the attacker has the listener running on his/her machine and the target connects to the attacker with a shell. So that attacker can access the target system.|
|2.|In Bind shell, the attacker finds an open port on the server/ target machine and then tries to bind his shell to that port.|In the reverse shell, the attacker opens his own port. So that victim can connect to that port for successful connection.|
|3.|The attacker must know the IP address of the victim before launching the Bind Shell.|The attacker doesn’t need to know the IP address of the victim, because the target is going to connect to our open port.|
|4.|In Bind shell, the listener is ON on the target machine and the attacker connects to it.|The Reverse shell is opposite of the Bind Shell, in the reverse shell, the listener is ON on the Attacker machine and the target machine connects to it.|
|5.|Bind Shell sometimes will fail, because modern firewalls don’t allow outsiders to connect to open ports.|Reverse Shell can bypass the firewall issues because this target machine tries to connect to the attacker, so the firewall doesn’t bother checking packets.|
