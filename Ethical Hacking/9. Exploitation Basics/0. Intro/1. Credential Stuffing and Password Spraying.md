Credential Stuffing is a cyberattack in which the attacker uses the list of credentials that are publicly available and then breaks into the system with various types of custom bots and other automation along with [IP spoofing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-spoofing/) to prevent getting blocked.

But as per the reports, only a small fraction of attacks that are carried out result in successful account takeover.

### Working of Credential Stuffing:

Generally, the attackers create automated tools like Bots that fetch the credentials from the dictionary of leaked credentials during data breaches and attempt to parallelly log into accounts to get access to web applications while spoofing the IP addresses, so they don’t get blocked by the system because of multiple failed attempts. After the attacker breaks into the system, he intends to obtain personal information, credit card details, or other data that may be private to the user or an organization.


# Password Spraying Attack

## Description

**Password spraying** is a type of brute force attack. In this attack, an attacker will brute force logins based on list of usernames with default passwords on the application. For example, an attacker will use one password (say, Secure@123) against many different accounts on the application to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

This attack can be found commonly where the application or admin sets a default password for the new users.

## Mitigations

- Brute force preventation should be on both field, i.e., Username and Password.
- Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent credentials from being guessed. Implement CAPTCHA, if lockout is not a viable option.
- The admin managed application should force users to change their password on first login with default password.
- Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.

**If you get a login portal, this should be a valid option, refer to this video to see how it works: https://youtu.be/ykHRLQM9vtg?list=PLKq1nta7fm-i-p75rNSNpodQmHIOP06NI**

## Credential Stuffing vs. Password Spraying

Password spraying works by taking a verified username and plugging it into several accounts in combination with several different common passwords. If a user doesn’t practice good password habits, most or all of their accounts can be jeopardized by guessing common passwords.

A credential stuffing attack depends on the reuse of passwords. With so many people reusing their passwords for multiple accounts, just one set of credentials is enough to expose most or all of their accounts. Cybercriminals utilize things like BotNets to execute multi-front attacks across multiple devices, expanding their attack capabilities with just one set of credentials.

When an attacker is successful in a credential stuffing attack, they can potentially take control of your bank information, social media accounts and more. This can lead to outright theft of money or other assets, extortion or identity.
