### What is a Stageless(non staged) payload 

`windows/shell_reverse_tcp` ?

A stageless payload is the simplest type of payload to understand, it contains everything you will need to get a reverse shell callback. Because of this, the file size is typically much larger and the program is relatively complex compared to that of a staged. This payload can be caught by listening on a raw socket. You can create a listener in Netcat, Python, Socat, etc.

In the diagram, our victim above is tricked into running stageless.exe, and an attacker recieves a callback to their Netcat listener over TCP/1337

### What is a Staged Payload 


`windows/shell/reverse_tcp` ?

a **staged payload** is usually sent in two parts. The first part contains a small primary payload that causes the victim machine to connect back to the attacker, transfer a larger secondary payload containing the rest of the shellcode, and then execute it.

In the diagram above, our victim is tricked into running the dropper, which beacons out to our C2 server to recieve a second stage which is then injected and executed in memory, which triggers a reverse shell callback.
