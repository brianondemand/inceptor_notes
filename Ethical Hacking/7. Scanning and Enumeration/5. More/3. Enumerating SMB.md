The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. The SMB protocol can be used on top of its TCP/IP protocol or other network protocols. Using the SMB protocol, an application (or the user of an application) can access files or other resources at a remote server. This allows applications to read, create, and update files on the remote server. SMB can also communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client request

# Enumeration

WE can launch up metasploit with the command **`msfconsole`** on linux and continue with the following:

```msf6
search auxiliary/scanner/smb
```

We can also used **`smbclient`** to check for shares:

```
smbclient -L \\\\172.16.216.130\\
```

*Notes:*
- **`smbclient`** works with backslashes(\\)
- Logon with **Anonymous**, do not need passwords
- You can also use enum4linux, a quick **`enum4linux --help`** should give you an insight on how to use it, it is also fast and straight forward

*Terms Used:*
- **Dead End:** As used with the tool `smbclient` and share `IPC$`, a dead end involves you can't or don't have permissions to enumerate further
