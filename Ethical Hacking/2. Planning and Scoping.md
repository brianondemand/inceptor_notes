One of the most important phases (if not the most important) of any penetration testing engagement is the planning and preparation phase. During this phase, you clearly scope your engagement. If you do not scope correctly, you will definitely run into issues with your client (if you work as a consultant) or with your boss (if you are part of a corporate red team), and you might even encounter legal problems.

A _red team_ is a group of cybersecurity experts and penetration testers hired by an organization to mimic a real threat actor by exposing vulnerabilities and risks regarding technology, people, and physical security. 

A _blue team_ is a corporate security team that defends the organization against cybersecurity threats (that is, the security operation center analysts, computer security incident response teams, information security teams, and others).

The following are some key concepts you must address and understand in the planning and preparation phase:

- The target audience
- The rules of engagement
- The communication escalation path and communication channels
- The available resources and requirements
- The overall budget for the engagement
- Any specific disclaimers
- Any technical constraints
- The resources available to you as a penetration tester

## Regulatory Compliance Considerations

You must be familiar with several regulatory compliance considerations in order to be successful in ethical hacking and penetration testing – not only to complete compliance-based assessments but also to understand what regulations may affect you and your client.

**PCI DSS**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) regulation aims to secure the processing of credit card payments and other types of digital payments.

**HIPAA**

The original intent of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulation was to simplify and standardize healthcare administrative processes. Administrative simplification called for the transition from paper records and transactions to electronic records and transactions. 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was instructed to develop and publish standards to protect an individual’s electronic health information while permitting appropriate access and use of that information by healthcare providers and other entities.

**FedRAMP**

The U.S. federal government uses the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standard to authorize the use of cloud service offerings.

---

Most of these regulations and specifications require the regulated company to hire third-party penetration testing firms to make sure they are compliant and to ensure that their security posture is acceptable.

You must also become familiar with different privacy-related regulations, such as the **_General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_**. GDPR includes strict rules around the processing of data and privacy. One of the GDPR’s main goals is to strengthen and unify data protection for individuals within the European Union (EU), while addressing the export of personal data outside the EU.

>The Wassenaar Arrangement was established for export control of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. Specific security tools (software and hardware) can be considered “arms” and can be controlled and restricted by certain national laws in various countries.


In order to become familiar with the rules related to completing a compliance-based assessment, you should become familiar with some of the key underlying regulations, such as those described in the following sections.

**Regulations in the Financial Sector**

In the financial sector, protecting customer and transactional data is more crucial than safeguarding money itself. Financial institutions must ensure privacy and security to maintain public trust and prevent threats like fraud and identity theft. Various regulations enforce this responsibility, including:

- **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act):** Mandates data protection for a broad range of financial institutions—including non-traditional ones like mortgage brokers, tax preparers, and credit card-issuing retailers. The FTC enforces GLBA for non-bank entities. It also requires periodic **penetration testing**.

This definition is important to understand because these financial institutions include many companies that are not traditionally considered to be financial institutions, including the following:

- Check-cashing businesses
- Payday lenders
- Mortgage brokers
- Nonbank lenders (for example, automobile dealers providing financial services)
- Technology vendors providing loans to clients
- Educational institutions providing financial aid
- Debt collectors
- Real estate settlement service providers
- Personal property or real estate appraisers
- Retailers that issue branded credit cards
- Professional tax preparers
- Courier services

The law also applies to companies that receive information about customers of other financial institutions, including credit reporting agencies and ATM operators.

- **NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation:** Requires institutions to perform **annual penetration tests** and **biannual vulnerability assessments**, with cybersecurity programs tailored to risk assessments and designed to ensure ongoing effectiveness.


Other governing bodies like **FFIEC**, **FDIC**, and state-level regulators also issue guidance and enforce security standards. These regulations are mandatory and foundational to the resilience and trustworthiness of the financial infrastructure.

**Regulations in the Healthcare Sector**  

The HIPAA Security Rule, published in 2003, mandates both technical and nontechnical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI). Enforcement was established in 2006, and further requirements were added by:

- The 2009 HITECH Act
    
- The 2009 Breach Notification Rule
    
- The 2013 Omnibus Rule (modifying HIPAA and incorporating the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)
    

The rule applies to **covered entities** (healthcare providers, plans, clearinghouses) and **business associates**, focusing on securing **individually identifiable health information** stored or transmitted electronically. HHS also provides cybersecurity guidance to help mitigate evolving threats like ransomware.

**Healthcare Provider**

A _healthcare provider_ is a person or an organization that provides patient or medical services, such as doctors, clinics, hospitals, and outpatient services; counseling; nursing home and hospice services; pharmacy services; medical diagnostic and imaging services; and durable medical equipment.

**Health Plan**

A _health plan_ is an entity that provides payment for medical services, such as health insurance companies, HMOs, government health plans, or government programs that pay for healthcare, such as Medicare, Medicaid, military, and veterans’ programs.

**Healthcare Clearinghouse**

A _healthcare clearinghouse_ is an entity that processes nonstandard health information it receives from another entity into a standard format.

**Business Associates**

_Business associates_ were initially defined as persons or organizations that perform certain functions or activities involving the use or disclosure of personal health information (PHI) on behalf of, or provide services to, a covered entity. Business associate services include legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, and financial services. Subsequent legislation expanded the definition of a business associate to a person or an entity that creates, receives, maintains, transmits, accesses, or has the potential to access PHI to perform certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity.

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

To protect cardholder data and reduce fraud, major payment brands (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express) created the **Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)** and developed **PCI DSS**. This standard must be followed by any organization that **transmits, processes, or stores** payment card data—or impacts its security—whether directly or through third parties. Organizations are responsible for ensuring third-party compliance as well.

Noncompliance can result in **fines, penalties**, or **loss of payment processing privileges**.

- **Acquirer**

	Also referred to as an “acquiring bank” or an “acquiring financial institution,” an entity that initiates and maintains relationships with merchants for the acceptance of payment cards.

- **ASV (approved scanning vendor)**

	An organization approved by the PCI SSC to conduct external vulnerability scanning services.

- **Merchant (PCI DSS)**  

	A **merchant** is any entity that **accepts payment cards** (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) for goods or services. A merchant can also be considered a **service provider** if it **stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data** on behalf of others—such as an ISP that accepts card payments for monthly services.


- **PAN (primary account number)**

	A payment card number that is up to 19 digits long.


- **Payment Brand**

	Brands such as Visa, MasterCard, Amex, or Discover.

- **PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)**

	A person trained and certified to investigate and contain information about cybersecurity incidents and breaches involving cardholder data.


- **Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)**

	An individual trained and certified to carry out PCI DSS compliance assessments.

- **Service Provider (PCI DSS)**  

	A **service provider** is any non-payment brand business that **processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data**, or provides services that **can impact the security** of that data. This includes **managed service providers** (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection) and **hosting providers**. Entities like telecom companies that **only provide communication links** (without access to application data) are **excluded**.

---

To prevent large-scale financial losses, **payment card brands require** all entities that **store, process, or transmit cardholder or sensitive authentication data** to **comply with PCI DSS**. 

The requirements cover **all system components** within the **cardholder data environment (CDE)**, which includes people, processes, and technology interacting with cardholder data.

**_Account Data Elements_**

The table below shows, account data consists of cardholder data as well as sensitive authentication data. A system component is any network component, server, or application that is included in, or connected to, the cardholder data environment. The _cardholder data environment_ is defined as the people, processes, and technology that handle cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.

| **Cardholder Data**          | **Sensitive Authentication Data**                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary account number (PAN) | Full magnetic stripe data or equivalent data on a chip |
| Cardholder name              | CAV2 / CVC2 / CVV2 / CID                               |
| Expiration date              | PINs / PIB blocks                                      |
| Service code                 |                                                        |

The **Primary Account Number (PAN)** determines if PCI DSS requirements apply. If the PAN is **stored, processed, or transmitted**, even with cardholder name, expiration date, or service code, then PCI DSS applies. The **PAN must always be stored in an unreadable (encrypted) format**. **Sensitive authentication data must never be stored after authorization**, even if encrypted.

The following are the typical elements on the front of a credit card:

- Embedded microchip
- PAN
- Expiration date
- Cardholder name

The **Luhn algorithm** is a publicly available method used to **validate credit card numbers** and other ID numbers using **modulo-10 math**.

**Typical credit card elements** include:

- **Front**: Microchip, PAN, expiration date, cardholder name
    
- **Back**: Magnetic stripe, and card security codes (CAV2/CID/CVC2/CVV2)

#### Key Technical Elements in Regulations You Should Consider

**Data Isolation**  

Organizations that need to comply with PCI DSS (and other regulations, for that matter) should have a data isolation strategy. Also known as network isolation or network segmentation, the goal is to implement a completely isolated network that includes all systems involved in payment card processing.

**Password Management**

Most regulations mandate solid password management strategies. For example, organizations must not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and security parameters. This requirement also extends far beyond its title and enters the realm of configuration management. In addition, most of these regulations mandate specific implementation standards, including password length, password complexity, and session timeout, as well as the use of multifactor authentication.

**Key Management**

**Key management is a critical, regulated element for effective cryptographic security.** Strong, protected keys determine how algorithms work and must be safeguarded against unauthorized access. NIST SP 800-57 provides essential guidance. **Poor key management can negate strong encryption.** Secure practices cover the entire key lifecycle: generation, storage, distribution, use, and destruction, ensuring data protection.

## Local Restrictions

**When conducting a penetration testing, be aware of local laws and restrictions, which vary by country and may limit testing activities.** Always secure clear written permission from the client to avoid legal issues like those under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. **Your contract and statement of work will be directly impacted by these limitations.**

Pre-engagement, identify testing constraints, including tool restrictions imposed by the client's business and technology. **Common constraints include:**

- Operational limitations preventing testing of certain areas/technologies (e.g., avoiding production database corruption).
- Organization-specific technologies.
- Skill set and exploit limitations.
- Out-of-scope critical or problematic systems.

**Clearly communicate all technical constraints with the client.**

Additionally, be mindful of local government requirements like GDPR and CCPA privacy laws. **Client corporate policies and specific regulations regarding vulnerability and penetration testing policies may also impose restrictions.** Always inquire about and document these policies and regulations.

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Category**                                                | **Description or Requirement**                                                             |
| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)                   | strengthens and unifies data privacy protections for individuals within the European Union |
| NIST SP 800-57                                              | guidelines for encryption key management                                                   |
| Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)      | secures the processing of credit card and other types of digital payments                  |
| Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)                               | applies to all financial services organizations, regardless of size                        |
| Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) | safeguards electronic health information                                                   |

## Legal Concepts

The following are several important legal concepts that you must know when performing a penetration test.

**Service-level agreement (SLA)**

An SLA is a well-documented expectation or constraint related to one or more of the minimum and/or maximum performance measures (such as quality, timeline/timeframe, and cost) of the penetration testing service. You should become familiar with any SLAs that the organization that hired you has provided to its customers.

**Confidentiality**

During penetration testing, it's crucial to discuss and agree with the client on how confidential data, like passwords, will be handled – specifically, what needs to be disclosed, who will have access, and the proper communication methods. You must also protect this sensitive data and adhere to the client's data retention policies, including deleting all records from your systems upon engagement completion to prevent cross-client data exposure.

**Statement of work (SOW)**

An SOW is a document that specifies the activities to be performed during a penetration testing engagement. It can be used to define some of the following elements:

- Project (penetration testing) timelines, including the report delivery schedule
- The scope of the work to be performed
- The location of the work (geographic location or network location)
- Special technical and nontechnical requirements
- Payment schedule
- Miscellaneous items that may not be part of the main negotiation but that need to be listed and tracked because they could pose problems during the overall engagement

The SOW can be a standalone document or can be part of a **_master service agreement (MSA)_**.  
 

>**NOTE** Use of the terms master and slave is ONLY in association with the official terminology used in industry specifications and standards and in no way diminishes Pearson’s commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion and challenging, countering, and/or combating bias and stereotyping in the global population of the learners we serve.


**Master service agreement (MSA)**

MSAs, which are very popular today, are contracts that can be used to quickly negotiate the work to be performed. When a master agreement is in place, the same terms do not have to be renegotiated every time you perform work for a customer. MSAs are especially beneficial when you perform a penetration test, and you know that you will be rehired on a recurring basis to perform additional tests in other areas of the company or to verify that the security posture of the organization has been improved as a result of prior testing and remediation.

**Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)***

A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a legal contract between a penetration tester and the hiring organization, defining confidential information that both parties must protect and not disclose. NDAs can be:

- **Unilateral:** Only one party (typically the client) shares confidential information that the other (the tester) must protect. The tester's findings are also confidential.
- **Bilateral (Mutual/Two-way):** Both parties share sensitive information and agree not to disclose it.
- **Multilateral:** Involves three or more parties where at least one shares confidential information that shouldn't be disclosed outside the agreement, often used when external partners are involved in the testing.

---
## Contracts

Contracts are vital in penetration testing, clearly outlining the agreement terms, payment, and services to be performed without ambiguity to avoid customer issues. Legal counsel is strongly advised. Clients may involve their legal teams and impose conditions like restricting where collected data can be accessed or prohibiting the removal of PII without specific authorization and adherence to relevant laws.

Crucially, the contract must have a signature from a proper signing authority and written authorization for the work. If third-party providers (ISPs, cloud services, etc.) might be affected, their written authorization is also necessary.

---
## Disclaimers

Disclaimers are important in penetration testing documentation (pre-engagement and final reports). You should specify the testing scope by date, acknowledging that cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities constantly evolve and no system is entirely immune. State that the report documents findings, and the client decides on remediation. Include that the report doesn't guarantee protection against personal or business loss.

Standard disclaimers also include that you provide no warranties, representations, or legal certifications about the tested systems, and the report doesn't guarantee the application's suitability, freedom from all vulnerabilities, or compliance/compatibility with industry standards, operating systems, or hardware. Consulting a lawyer to create customized disclaimers is a best practice.
