One of the most important phases (if not the most important) of any penetration testing engagement is the planning and preparation phase. During this phase, you clearly scope your engagement. If you do not scope correctly, you will definitely run into issues with your client (if you work as a consultant) or with your boss (if you are part of a corporate red team), and you might even encounter legal problems.

A _red team_ is a group of cybersecurity experts and penetration testers hired by an organization to mimic a real threat actor by exposing vulnerabilities and risks regarding technology, people, and physical security. 

A _blue team_ is a corporate security team that defends the organization against cybersecurity threats (that is, the security operation center analysts, computer security incident response teams, information security teams, and others).

The following are some key concepts you must address and understand in the planning and preparation phase:

- The target audience
- The rules of engagement
- The communication escalation path and communication channels
- The available resources and requirements
- The overall budget for the engagement
- Any specific disclaimers
- Any technical constraints
- The resources available to you as a penetration tester

## Regulatory Compliance Considerations

You must be familiar with several regulatory compliance considerations in order to be successful in ethical hacking and penetration testing – not only to complete compliance-based assessments but also to understand what regulations may affect you and your client.

#### PCI DSS

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) regulation aims to secure the processing of credit card payments and other types of digital payments.

#### HIPAA

The original intent of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulation was to simplify and standardize healthcare administrative processes. Administrative simplification called for the transition from paper records and transactions to electronic records and transactions. 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was instructed to develop and publish standards to protect an individual’s electronic health information while permitting appropriate access and use of that information by healthcare providers and other entities.

#### FedRAMP

The U.S. federal government uses the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standard to authorize the use of cloud service offerings.

Most of these regulations and specifications require the regulated company to hire third-party penetration testing firms to make sure they are compliant and to ensure that their security posture is acceptable.

You must also become familiar with different privacy-related regulations, such as the **_General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_**. GDPR includes strict rules around the processing of data and privacy. One of the GDPR’s main goals is to strengthen and unify data protection for individuals within the European Union (EU), while addressing the export of personal data outside the EU.

>The Wassenaar Arrangement was established for export control of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. Specific security tools (software and hardware) can be considered “arms” and can be controlled and restricted by certain national laws in various countries.


In order to become familiar with the rules related to completing a compliance-based assessment, you should become familiar with some of the key underlying regulations, such as those described in the following sections.

**Regulations in the Financial Sector**

In the financial sector, protecting customer and transactional data is more crucial than safeguarding money itself. Financial institutions must ensure privacy and security to maintain public trust and prevent threats like fraud and identity theft. Various regulations enforce this responsibility, including:

- **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act):** Mandates data protection for a broad range of financial institutions—including non-traditional ones like mortgage brokers, tax preparers, and credit card-issuing retailers. The FTC enforces GLBA for non-bank entities. It also requires periodic **penetration testing**.
    
- **NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation:** Requires institutions to perform **annual penetration tests** and **biannual vulnerability assessments**, with cybersecurity programs tailored to risk assessments and designed to ensure ongoing effectiveness.
    

Other governing bodies like **FFIEC**, **FDIC**, and state-level regulators also issue guidance and enforce security standards. These regulations are mandatory and foundational to the resilience and trustworthiness of the financial infrastructure.
