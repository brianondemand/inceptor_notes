When testing for XSS we can test for HTML Injection first, this is because HTML Injection is more likely to work and once we know that we can find our way around to trigger XSS.

First of all we can do something like - `<h1>this is a test</h1>` - and see if it is executed

Hell yeah, it got executed, we can see that the keyword **"this is a text"** appears to be formatted in html as an heading, i also tested this out in multiple [containers](https://itsfoss.com/firefox-containers/) to see if it is stored.

As usual using this payload - `<script>alert(1)</script>` - we were able to get a stored XSS on all containers.

We can attempt to steal others cookie by using the payload - `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
