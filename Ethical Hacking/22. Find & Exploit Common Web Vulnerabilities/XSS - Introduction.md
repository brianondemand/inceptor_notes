## **Overview**

**What is XSS**
- XSS stands for Cross-site Scripting
- It allows us to execute JavaScript in a victim's browser
- We have 3 types of XSS which are
	- **Reflected** - is where the script we are trying to inject comes from the current http request, it is somehow limited cos' it looks like we are only targeting ourselves
	- **Stored** - This one is much more powerful because our payload is stored in something like a database and then can be retrieved later
	- **DOM** - **enables attackers to inject a malicious payload into a web page by manipulating the client's browser environment**. Since these attacks rely on the Document Object Model, they are orchestrated on the client-side after loading the page.
