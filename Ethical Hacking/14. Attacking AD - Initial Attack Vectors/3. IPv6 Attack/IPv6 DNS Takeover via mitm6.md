First of all install [pimpmykali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) cos' the tool `mitm6` doesn't come pre-installed with kali linux

Change directory to `/opt/mitm6` and install the necessary requirements

```shell
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:/opt/mitm6$ cd /opt/mitm6      

sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:/opt/mitm6$ sudo pip2 install .

sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:/opt/mitm6$ cd ~         

sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~$ 
```

### Setting up ntlmrelayx and mitm6

On your terminal do :

```shell
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~/PEH/AD$ sudo ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.0.110 -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l bankai

Note that `-6` represents IPv6 `-t` for DC-IP address `-wh` for fake web proxy auto-discovery `-l` will create a folder named **bankai**

Then start up the `mitm6` server with the following command :

```shell
sec-fortress@Pwn-F0rk-3X3C:~$ sudo mitm6 -d marvel.local
```

Now we can go ahead and re-boot our `THE-PUNISHER` machine and focus on our terminal

>Note that the target we interact with depends on our output

Checking your present folder, `~/PEH/AD` , you should have a folder with the folder name when you specified the `-l` option, this folder contains sensitive files in **html, grep and json** format (HTML formats are the best)

The highlighted ones as shown below are very important :

We can also do other stuff like creating another user, first of all we can login as the local admin

Then since this is recorded as an event, we can go back to our `ntlmrelayx.py` tool page on your terminal, checking the output you should see a new user created with the password

PS: If you can't find one just restart your `mitm6` tool and `ntlmrelayx.py` , also try restarting the system (THE-PUNISHER), you should see it ðŸ¤Ÿ
