**Ethical hacking** is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, or applications for security vulnerabilities.

An ethical hacker’s goal is to analyze the security posture of a network’s or system’s infrastructure in an effort to identify and possibly exploit any security weaknesses found and then determine if a compromise is possible. 

This process is called _security_ **_penetration testing_** or _ethical_ _hacking_.

A security researcher looking for vulnerabilities in products, applications, or web services is considered an ethical hacker if he or she responsibly discloses those vulnerabilities to the vendors or owners of the targeted research.

 However, the same type of “research” performed by someone who then uses the same **_vulnerability_** to gain unauthorized access to a target network/system would be considered a nonethical hacker. 
 
 We could even go so far as to say that someone who finds a vulnerability and discloses it publicly without working with a vendor is considered a nonethical hacker – because this could lead to the compromise of networks/systems by others who use this information in a malicious way.

As an ethical hacker, you use the same tools to find vulnerabilities and exploit targets as do nonethical hackers. However, as an ethical hacker, you would typically report your findings to the vendor or customer you are helping to make the network more secure. You would also try to avoid performing any tests or exploits that might be destructive in nature.


## Need for Penetration Testing?

First of all, as someone who is responsible for securing and defending a network/system, you want to find any possible paths of compromise before the attacker do.

To know if those defenses really work and whether they are enough to keep out the attackers?

How valuable is the data that we are protecting, and are we protecting the right things? 

These are some of the questions that should be answered by a penetration test.

When it comes to information security, we need to determine what it is we are protecting and whether our defenses can hold up to the threats that are imposed on them.

Simply implementing a firewall, an IPS, anti-malware, a VPN, a web application firewall (WAF), and other modern security defenses isn’t enough. You also need to test their validity. And you need to do this on a regular basis. 

As you know, networks and systems change constantly. This means the attack surface can change as well, and when it does, you need to consider reevaluating the security posture by way of a penetration test.

## Threat Actors

Before you can understand how an ethical hacker or penetration tester can mimic a **_threat actor_** (or malicious attacker), you need to understand the different types of threat actors.


#### 1. Organized Crime

Organized crime consists of very well-funded and motivated groups that will typically use any and all of the latest attack techniques. Whether that is ransomware or data theft, if it can be monetized, organized crime will use it.

#### 2. Hacktivists

This type of threat actor is not motivated by money. Hacktivists are looking to make a point or to further their beliefs, using cybercrime as their method of attack. These types of attacks are often carried out by stealing sensitive data and then revealing it to the public for the purpose of embarrassing or financially affecting a target.

#### 3. State-Sponsored Attackers

Cyber war and cyber espionage are two terms that fit into this category. Many governments around the world today use cyber attacks to steal information from their opponents and cause disruption.

#### 4. Insider Threats

An insider threat is a threat that comes from inside an organization. The motivations of these types of actors are normally different from those of many of the other common threat actors. Insider threats are often normal employees who are tricked into divulging sensitive information or mistakenly clicking on links that allow attackers to gain access to their computers. However, they could also be malicious insiders who are possibly motivated by revenge or money.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

It is important to follow well-known methods and standards in order to approach pentesting engagements in an organized, systematic way.

Its good to understand the major documented methodologies and standards so that you can create strategies that draw on their strengths. 

Documenting your approach with the methodologies and standards that you used also provides accountability  and helps make our results defensible in case issues arise with our customers.

The tools and techniques used to assess the security posture of a network or system also vary. The networks and systems being evaluated are often highly complex. Because of this, it is very easy when performing a penetration test to go off scope. This is where testing methodologies come in.

Why Do We Need to Follow a Methodology for Penetration Testing: when performing a penetration test for a customer, you must show that the methods you plan to use for testing are tried and true. By utilizing a known methodology, you are able to provide documentation of a specialized procedure that has been used by many people.

## Environmental Considerations

There are, of course, a number of different types of penetration tests. Often they are combined in the overall scope of a penetration test; however, they can also be performed as individual tests as well.

The following is a list of some of the most common environmental considerations for the types of penetration tests today:


**Network Infrastructure Tests**

Network infrastructure testing focuses on evaluating the security of components like switches, routers, firewalls, AAA servers, and IPSs to assess their ability to defend against attacks. Wireless penetration testing may also be included, involving attempts to bypass security or break encryption. Testing wireless infrastructure helps identify vulnerabilities and exposure, often using tools like heat maps to visualize signal coverage and weaknesses.


**Application-Based Tests**

This type of pen testing focuses on testing for security weaknesses in enterprise applications. These weaknesses can include but are not limited to misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws. Because a web application is typically built on a web server with a back-end database, the testing scope normally includes the database as well. 

However, it focuses on gaining access to that supporting database through the web application compromise. A great resource that we mention a number of times in this book is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).


**Penetration Testing in the Cloud**

Cloud service providers like Azure, AWS, and GCP must prioritize security and compliance. Security responsibilities vary based on the cloud model (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), with customers taking on more responsibility in IaaS. Both the provider and client share cloud security duties, which must be clearly defined in contracts. These contracts should address disaster recovery, SLAs, data integrity, encryption, and key management. CSPs should offer equivalent security layers as traditional on-premises services. Penetration testing in the cloud is restricted by provider policies, and data still resides in physical locations, requiring written agreements to meet security expectations.

## Environment Test

When talking about penetration testing methods, you are likely to hear the terms unknown-environment (previously known as _black-box_), known-environment (previously known as _white-box_), and partially known environment (previously known as _gray-box_) testing. These terms are used to describe the perspective from which the testing is performed, as well as the amount of information that is provided to the tester:


**Unknown-Environment Test**

An unknown-environment penetration test gives the tester minimal information—typically just domain names and IP addresses—to simulate an external attacker's perspective. The tester gathers intel from public sources without prior knowledge of the target’s infrastructure. Often, even internal staff are unaware of the test timing, enabling a realistic defense assessment and a more accurate view of the organization’s actual security posture.


**Known-Environment Test**

In a known-environment penetration test, the tester is given detailed information about the organization's infrastructure—such as network diagrams, configurations, and user credentials—to thoroughly identify security vulnerabilities. This broader-scope test often includes internal audits and system scans. Unlike unknown-environment tests that simulate external attacks, known-environment tests focus on depth over realism. Time, budget, and specific concerns influence the chosen approach, and given today’s advanced threats, this “white-box” method can be highly effective.


**Partially Known Environment Test**

A partially known environment penetration test combines elements of both known and unknown testing. Testers may receive limited credentials but not full network documentation, simulating an attack with partial insider access. Often starting from a compromised client machine, testers attempt to pivot through the network to assess the potential impact of a real-world breach from within.

## Standards and Methodologies

There are a number of penetration testing methodologies that have been around for a while and continue to be updated as new threats emerge.

The following is a list of some of the most common penetration testing methodologies and other standards:


**MITRE ATT&CK**  

The MITRE ATT&CK framework  is an amazing resource for learning about an adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Both offensive security professionals (penetration testers, red teamers, bug hunters, and so on) and incident responders and threat hunting teams use the MITRE ATT&CK framework today. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a collection of different matrices of tactics, techniques, and subtechniques. These matrices–including the Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix, Network, Cloud, ICS, and Mobile–list the tactics and techniques that adversaries use while preparing for an attack, including gathering of information (open-source intelligence [OSINT], technical and people weakness identification, and more) as well as different exploitation and post-exploitation techniques. You will learn more about MITRE ATT&CK throughout this course.


**OWASP WSTG**  

The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) is a comprehensive guide focused on web application testing. It is a compilation of many years of work by OWASP members. OWASP WSTG covers the high-level phases of web application security testing and digs deeper into the testing methods used. For instance, it goes as far as providing attack vectors for testing cross-site scripting (XSS), XML external entity (XXE) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection attacks; as well as how to prevent and mitigate these attacks. You will learn more about these attacks in Module 6, “Exploiting Application-Based Vulnerabilities.” From a web application security testing perspective, OWASP WSTG is the most detailed and comprehensive guide available.


**NIST SP 800-115**

Special Publication (SP) 800-115 is a document created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST SP 800-115 provides organizations with guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing. It superseded the previous standard document, SP 800-42. SP 800-115 is considered an industry standard for penetration testing guidance and is called out in many other industry standards and documents.

**OSSTMM**  

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), developed by Pete Herzog, has been around a long time. Distributed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM), the OSSTMM is a document that lays out repeatable and consistent security testing. It is currently in version 3, and version 4 is in draft status. The OSSTMM has the following key sections:

- Operational Security Metrics
- Trust Analysis
- Work Flow
- Human Security Testing
- Physical Security Testing
- Wireless Security Testing
- Telecommunications Security Testing
- Data Networks Security Testing
- Compliance Regulations
- Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)


**PTES**

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) provides information about types of attacks and methods, and it provides information on the latest tools available to accomplish the testing methods outlined. PTES involves seven distinct phases:

1. Pre-engagement interactions
2. Intelligence gathering
3. Threat modeling
4. Vulnerability analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-exploitation
7. Reporting

**ISSAF**

The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is another penetration testing methodology similar to the others on this list with some additional phases. ISSAF covers the following phases:

- Information gathering
- Network mapping
- Vulnerability identification
- Penetration
- Gaining access and privilege escalation
- Enumerating further
- Compromising remote users/sites
- Maintaining access
- Covering the tracks

## Building Your Own Lab

You should never practice ethical hacking on client networks. Instead, use simulated targets or environments you have permission to access. Always consider the legal implications of your actions, as laws vary by region. 

Before using tools in real environments, test them in a controlled lab setup to avoid causing harm. For critical customer networks, ensure tools are tested and reliable. Lab environments allow safer testing, especially when working with devices in isolated networks. 

Popular Linux distributions like Kali, Parrot OS, and BlackArch offer ready-to-use pen testing tools, and you can set up a basic lab using virtual machines in VirtualBox or VMware.

### Requirements and Guidelines for Penetration Testing Labs

The following table contains a list of requirements and guidelines for a typical penetration testing environment.

|Requirement or Guideline|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Closed network**|You need to ensure controlled access to and from the lab environment and restricted access to the internet.|
|**Virtualized computing environment**|This allows for easy deployment and recovery of devices being tested.|
|**Realistic environment** 1|If you are staging a testing environment, it should match the real environment as closely as possible.|
|**Health monitoring**|When something crashes, you need to be able to determine why it happened.|
|**Sufficient hardware resources**|You need to be sure that a lack of resources is not the cause of false results.|
|**Multiple operating systems**|Many times you will want to test or validate a finding from another system. It is always good to test from different operating systems to see if the results differ.|
|**Duplicate tools**|A great way to validate a finding is to run the same test with a different tool to see if the results are the same.|
|**Practice targets**|You need to practice using your tools. To do this, you need to practice on targets that are known to be vulnerable.|

#### Tools Used in Your Lab

When testing a customer environment, various attack surfaces may be evaluated, including network and wireless infrastructure, servers, operating systems, and mobile platforms. 

Different tools are used depending on the target—network tools for traffic manipulation and bypassing defenses, wireless tools for encryption cracking and on-path attacks, and web tools for automated scanning and manual vulnerability testing. 

Servers and client systems are often tested using vulnerability scanners, while mobile apps and their APIs require specialized tools. Fuzzing tools are also important for testing protocol robustness.

#### Kali Linux

Kali can be a little overwhelming at first because it has so many tools. It is a Linux distro, so if you don’t have good Linux skills it can be hard to use. Many tools only operate in a terminal. To help you get the most from Kali, use this lab as an opportunity to get familiar with it and brush up on your basic Linux skills.
