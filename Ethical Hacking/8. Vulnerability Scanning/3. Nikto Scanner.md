Nikto is a vulnerability scanner part of Kali Linux and is widely used to find vulnerabilities in Web servers. It performs various tasks, including:

- Scan for the existence of more than one index file.
- Verify the installed applications and Webserver.
- Verify the Web server configuration.
- Verify the outdated files, such as plugins.


#### Advantages of Nikto

1. **Open** **Source**: Nikto is an open-source tool, making it accessible to users without any licensing costs. This accessibility contributes to its popularity in the cybersecurity community.
   
2. **Wide** **Compatibility**: It is platform-agnostic, capable of running on Windows, Linux, and macOS, ensuring that users can leverage its capabilities regardless of their preferred environment.
   
3. **Comprehensive** **Scans**: Nikto performs thorough scans, identifying a wide range of potential vulnerabilities, including outdated software, risky configurations, and known security issues.
   
4. **Constant** **Updates**: The Nikto database is continually updated, ensuring that it remains current with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
   
5. **Customizable** **Scans**: Nikto allows for the creation of custom scan profiles, offering users a high degree of flexibility to suit their specific requirements.
   
6. **Reporting**: It provides detailed and well-structured reports, which are valuable for risk assessment and mitigation planning.

#### Disadvantages of Nikto

1. **False Positives and Negatives**: Like many vulnerability scanners, Nikto is not foolproof and can sometimes produce false positives or negatives. It is essential to validate its findings manually.
   
2. **No Authentication**: Nikto doesn’t support authentication. While this might be an advantage for some situations, it could limit its effectiveness in others.
   
3. **Limited to Web Servers**: Nikto primarily focuses on web servers and web applications, so it may not be suitable for assessing other aspects of your network.

### Use Nikto for Web Application Vulnerability Scanning

Type the following in the **Terminal** window:

```c
sudo nikto -host intranet
```

The vulnerability scanning process starts.

Notice the listed details of the scanned target — **Target IP**, **Target Hostname**, **Target Port**, and **Start Time**.

Depending on the number of vulnerabilities, the process may run for a few minutes.

You can also specify the port number on which the Website or Web application should be scanned. To do this, type the following command:

```c
sudo nikto -host intranet -p 80
```

Notice that the process and output are similar to the previous command.

To scan a website for vulnerabilities and save the output to an HTML file, type the following command:

> *Instead of the -host parameter, you can also use the -h parameter. Both parameters provide the same result.*

```c
sudo nikto -host intranet -o plab.html
```

Let the vulnerability scanning process complete.

Then, type the following command:

```c
firefox plab.html
```
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*P913cdaUfeyWz9AvHRwz4A.png)

A new **Firefox** window opens. Notice you can see the list of vulnerabilities on the HTML webpage.

# Mitigating the Risks

Nikto’s primary function is to identify vulnerabilities; the next crucial step is to mitigate these risks. Once you have the scan results, consider the following actions:

1. **Patch and Update**: Address identified vulnerabilities by applying the necessary patches and updates to your web server software and dependencies.
2. **Configuration Review**: Carefully examine the server’s configuration to ensure that it adheres to security best practices.
3. **Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to any new vulnerabilities that may arise in the future.
4. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection**: Consider the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to further enhance security.
5. **Regular Scans**: Schedule regular Nikto scans to monitor the server’s security posture and address vulnerabilities promptly.
