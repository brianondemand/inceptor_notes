The `shebang` in a Bash script is the first line of the script, beginning with `#!`, followed by the path to the interpreter that should execute the script. For Bash scripts, this typically points to the Bash executable.

Purpose:

- It informs the operating system which program (the interpreter) should be used to execute the commands within the script.
- This ensures the script runs with the intended shell, even if the user's default shell is different.

Common Bash Shebangs:

- `#!/bin/bash`: This is the most common and direct way to specify the Bash interpreter. It assumes Bash is located at `/bin/bash`.
  
- `#!/usr/bin/env bash`: This alternative uses the `env` command to locate the `bash` executable within the system's `PATH`. This can be more portable as it doesn't rely on a fixed path, but rather on the environment's configuration.

Example 1:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello from a Bash script!"
ls -l
```

In this example, `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to run the `echo` and `ls -l` commands.


Example 2:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List of IP addresses (add your own here)
ip_list=("8.8.8.8" "1.1.1.1" "192.168.1.1")

# Loop through each IP and ping it
for ip in "${ip_list[@]}"
do
    echo "Pinging $ip..."
    ping -c 4 "$ip"
    echo "----------------------------------------"
done

```
