## PART 3

**Task 1: Introduction**  
This part zeroes in on system security and data protection—core pillars of a reliable computing environment.

**Task 2: Windows Updates**  
Windows Update ensures the OS receives critical patches, drivers, and feature upgrades. Timely updates close security gaps and enhance system stability. Administrators can manage update settings through Group Policy or Windows Update for Business to control deployment.

**Task 3: Windows Security**  
Windows Security is the built-in suite for endpoint protection. It includes antivirus, firewall, and performance health monitors. It centralizes security settings and reports, giving users a simple overview of their protection status.

**Task 4: Virus & Threat Protection**  
This module is powered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It provides real-time scanning, threat history, and protection updates. It can be paired with controlled folder access to protect files from ransomware and unauthorized apps.

**Task 5: Firewall & Network Protection**  
The Windows Firewall monitors incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent unauthorized access. Users can configure rules for private, public, or domain networks. It’s a first line of defense against lateral attacks and untrusted applications.

**Task 6: App & Browser Control**  
This section governs application and browser behavior using SmartScreen. It flags suspicious downloads and blocks unrecognized apps. It’s particularly useful in preventing phishing attacks and drive-by downloads in browsers like Edge.

**Task 7: Device Security**  
Device Security ensures hardware-based protection is in place. Features like Secure Boot, TPM (Trusted Platform Module), and Core Isolation protect the system’s integrity from the ground up. These tools form the root of trust in modern Windows devices.

**Task 8: BitLocker**  
BitLocker encrypts entire drives, preventing unauthorized access to data—even if the drive is removed. It's especially useful in business environments where data breaches can occur due to lost or stolen devices. BitLocker can be managed via Group Policy or Active Directory.

**Task 9: Volume Shadow Copy Service**  
Volume Shadow Copy enables backup of system and user files even while they're in use. It powers features like System Restore and File History. This service plays a critical role in disaster recovery and versioning of documents.
