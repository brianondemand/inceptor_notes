OWASP Zap is a security testing framework much like Burp Suite. It acts as a very robust enumeration tool. It’s used to test web applications. (_Zed_ Attack Proxy)

**What are the benefits to OWASP ZAP?**

It’s completely open source and free. There is no premium version, no features are locked behind a paywall, and there is no proprietary code.

There’s a couple of feature benefits too with using OWASP ZAP over Burp Suite:

- Automated Web Application Scan: This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities. This is a paid feature in Burp. 

- Web Spidering: You can passively build a website map with Spidering. This is a paid feature in Burp.

- Unthrottled Intruder: You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle. This is a paid feature in Burp.

- No need to forward individual requests through Burp: When doing manual attacks, having to change windows to send a request through the browser, and then forward in burp, can be tedious. OWASP handles both and you can just browse the site and OWASP will intercept automatically. This is NOT a feature in Burp.

ZAP can be used as your go-to tool to start Web Application testing but it should not be your only tool. ZAP is just one of many tools to put under your hacker utility belt.

### Automated Scan

The automated scan performs both passive and automated scans to build a sitemap and detect vulnerabilities.

**A traditional spider** scan is a passive scan that enumerates links and directories of the website. It builds a website index without brute-forcing. This is much quieter than a brute-force attack and can still net a login page or other juicy details, but is not as comprehensive as a bruteforce.  

**The Ajax Spider** is an add-on that integrates in ZAP a crawler of AJAX rich sites called Crawljax. You can use it in conjunction with the traditional spider for better results. It uses your web browser and proxy.

### Manual Scan

Like Burp, you should set-up your proxy between OWASP ZAP and your Browser. We’ll be using Firefox.
