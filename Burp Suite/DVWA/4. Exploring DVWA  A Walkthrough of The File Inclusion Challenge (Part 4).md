> **Introduction**

In this article, we’ll dive into the DVWA File Inclusion challenge and work through all its security levels. Step by step, we’ll solve each level, uncover the protections in place, and figure out how to bypass them.

> **What is File Inclusion?**

File Inclusion is a vulnerability where an application lets users choose which files to load. If it’s not handled securely, hackers can exploit it to load sensitive files or even run harmful code.

Low Security Source Code

The code takes a value from the page parameter in the URL using the GET method and assigns it to the $file variable, which will then be loaded and displayed on the web page. The lack of validation or sanitization makes it vulnerable to File Inclusion attacks.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to specify any file within the server by manipulating the page parameter in the URL. Since the input isn’t properly checked, the attacker can control which file gets loaded, including files outside of the intended directory.

For example, an attacker can use the../../../../../../ sequence to move up the directory structure, escaping the intended directory and accessing higher-level directories. This could allow them to reach sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd.

Manipulating URL to Reach /etc/passwd File

In here, we’re leaving the /var/www/html directory, which is usually the web server’s root, and heading into the server’s home directory. From there, we move into the /etc directory and access the passwd file, which holds sensitive system information, using the relative path traversal technique. This is an example of a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack, where we are exploiting the vulnerability to include local files on the server.

As a result, the content of the /etc/passwd file is now displayed.

Viewing the Content of the /etc/passwd File

Now, let’s take a look at Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This vulnerability lets an attacker include files from remote servers, which could allow them to run malicious code. We’ll see how this can be exploited in our case.

First, we will create the test and shell.php files, as shown below.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JjIoEIXXCrHYPS6vE6iOeg.png)

Displaying Contents of test and shell.php Files

We need to open Python’s simple HTTP server to make the file available over the network.

Starting an HTTP Server Using Python

After starting the Python HTTP server, paste [http://192.168.44.171:8000/test](http://192.168.44.171:8000/test) into the page URL parameter to open the contents of the test file.

Accessing File test via Python HTTP Server

It worked, and the file content is now displayed.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-K3xUDlYomw2TPgvwPUPwg.png)

Displaying the Content of the test File on the Victim’s Machine

The GET request for the test file is also displayed in the console output of python -m http.server.

Viewing test File Retrieval on Python HTTP Server

Now, we will test with the shell.php file, which opens a reverse shell, connecting the server to the attacker’s IP and port, allowing remote control of the server.

We’ll enter the shell.php file URL in the page parameter to trigger the reverse shell.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VosFyVkOLB3eLz1v5m_D8g.png)

Accessing shell.php via Python HTTP Server

By using the nc command, we can listen for the incoming connection from the reverse shell and interact with the server remotely.

Medium Security Source Code

After looking through the code, i noticed it uses the str\_replace function to remove http:// and https:// by replacing them with an empty string. This behavior effectively strips these prefixes from any input. Similarly, both../ and..\\\\ are replaced with an empty string.

However, if we use …/./, the../ in the middle is replaced with a blank space, and the remaining values collapse to../, allowing us to navigate using this approach.

```c
..././ ---> ../
```

So For the LFI attack, we will be using this path

```c
..././..././..././..././..././..././etc/passwd
```

Navigating to /etc/passwd in the URL

As you can see, it worked perfectly, and we were able to access the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

Displaying the Content of /test/passwd on the Victim Machine

Now let’s move on to RFI. We’ll apply the same technique by inserting http:// within the URL, like this hthttp://tp://, which seamlessly turns into http:// to bypass the check.

```c
hthttp://tp:// ---> http://
```

Accessing File test via Python HTTP Server

It worked as shown below, where we can clearly see the contents of the test file.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*WvfjqpT8Kg76v1D9VDxIrA.png)

Displaying This is an RFI Test on the Victim Machine

Next, let’s test with the shell file.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*4JedTNX-hSZesKQYaPNT4w.png)

Accessing File shell via Python HTTP Server

As you can see, it worked as well, and we successfully received a shell.

Receiving a Shell on the Victim Machine

> **Analyzing High Security Source Code**

High Security Source Code

After reviewing the code, I found that it throws an error if the file doesn’t start with file and isn’t include.php.

To solve this, we’ll use the file:// protocol, which allows us to read local files from the system rather than from the web server.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*52dssOAn44VFuAEVU2iMYQ.png)

Manipulating URL with file:// to Display /etc/passwd Content

For RFI, it’s not possible due to the security measures implemented, which effectively prevent any attempts.

> **Conclusion**

We worked through the File Inclusion challenge step by step, starting with simple issues and gradually overcoming security barriers, highlighting the process of exploiting these vulnerabilities.
