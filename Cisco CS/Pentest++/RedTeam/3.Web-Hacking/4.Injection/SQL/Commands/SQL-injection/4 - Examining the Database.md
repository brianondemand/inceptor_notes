
## Examining the Database

Following initial identification of an SQL injection vulnerability, it is generally useful to obtain
some information about the database itself. This information can often pave the way for further
exploitation.
- Specific syntax depends on the database type

Enumerating Version (Oracle)
```
SELECT * FROM v$version
```

Enumerating Tables
```
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
```


## More Examination

Information you need to gather:
- Type of database software
- Version of database software
- Contents of the database (columns and tables)

```
' UNION SELECT @@version--
```

Might return the following version information:
