## What is SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that is used to securely connect to remote systems over an unsecured network, such as the internet. SSH provides a secure encrypted connection between a client and a server, allowing users to remotely access and control systems and services.

SSH works by creating a secure channel between the client and the server using encryption algorithms to secure the connection. This secure channel can be used to run various network services and applications, such as a command shell, file transfer protocol, or remote desktop application.

## Find SSH Port
Nmap
```
nmap -sV -SC IP -p20,21
```

- Possible to find SSH on an other port

## Attack
- Brute Force
```Terminal
hydra -t X -l USERNAME -P WORDLIST -vV IP ssh
```

Let's break it down:

- hydra      --->  Runs the hydra tool  
- -t X         --->  Number of parallel connections per target  
- -l             ---> Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise  
- -P            ---> Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords  
- -vV          ---> Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows login + password 
- IP             ---> The IP address of the target machine  
- ssh           --->  Sets the protocol

## Connection

### Windows Connection
- Option
```Terminal
Remmina (tool)
```

### Active Directory Connection
- Options
