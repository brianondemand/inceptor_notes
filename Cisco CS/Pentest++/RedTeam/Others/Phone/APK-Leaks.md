## What is APK Leaks?
An APK leak tool is a software application designed to scan and identify APK files that are leaking sensitive information or being distributed without proper authorization. APK files are the installation packages for Android applications, and they can contain sensitive data such as login credentials, personal information, and intellectual property.

APK leak tools typically use a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify potential leaks. Static analysis involves examining the APK file's code and resources, while dynamic analysis involves running the APK file in a simulated environment to monitor its behavior.

Once potential leaks are identified, the APK leak tool may provide recommendations for remediation or automatically block the APK file from being distributed. This helps organizations and developers protect their sensitive information and prevent unauthorized distribution of their applications.

## Common Use and Commands:

```
apkleaks -f ~/path/to/file.apk -o secret-output.txt
```

```
apktool d FILE
```
- Decompile the app
