
Heuristic-based detection involves using algorithms and other techniques to analyze the behavior of a file or program and identify patterns or characteristics that are associated with malware. This method is useful for detecting unknown or zero-day threats, as it does not rely on a database of known malware signatures. However, it can also result in false positives, where a benign file or program is mistakenly identified as malicious.
