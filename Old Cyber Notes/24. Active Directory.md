Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is used for managing and organizing users, computers, and resources within an organization.

As a directory service, it serves as a centralized database that stores information about objects within the network, such as users, groups, computers, and printers. This allows administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources effectively.

 It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Primarily, AD stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. Understanding its basic components is crucial for effective AD management.

**Key Components of Active Directory:**

1. **Domain:** A domain is a central part of AD’s structure. It’s a logical group of network objects, like users, computers, and devices, that share the same AD database. A domain is managed by a domain controller.
   
2. **Domain Controller (DC):** A server that responds to security authentication requests within a Windows Server domain. It stores user account information, authenticates users, and enforces security policies for a domain.
   
3. **Organizational Unit (OU):** These are containers within a domain that can hold users, groups, computers, and other OUs. They provide a way to organize directory objects into logical hierarchies, offering more granular control over the management of these objects.
   
4. **Global Catalog (GC):** This is a distributed data repository that contains a searchable, partial representation of every object in every domain in a multi-domain AD forest. It helps in locating objects from any domain without needing their domain name.
   
5. **Schema:** The schema is a component of AD that defines all the objects and attributes that the directory service can manage. It determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in the directory and the attributes of those objects.

### 1. Domain

A **domain** is a logical grouping of network objects (users, computers, printers, devices) that share the same **Active Directory database** and security policies. It is the **core structure of Active Directory** and helps organize resources efficiently.

**Key Features of a Domain:**

- Managed by one or more **Domain Controllers (DCs)**.
- Uses a **single security boundary**—meaning all objects within a domain follow the same policies and authentication rules.
- Identified by a **Domain Name System (DNS) name**, such as **example.com**.
- Users and computers in the domain authenticate against the **Domain Controller**.

**Example of a Domain in AD:**

If a company **"TechCorp"** has an AD environment, their domain might be:

```
techcorp.com
```

Users in this domain would have login usernames like:

```
john.doe@techcorp.com
```


### 2. Domain Controller (DC) - Heart of AD

A **Domain Controller (DC)** is a Windows Server that stores, manages, and processes authentication requests for a domain. It **enforces security policies and manages logins**.

**AD DS Data Store:**

This contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services, and applications. It consists of:

- NTDS.dit (**NT Directory Services Directory Information Tree**) file is the database file used by Active Directory to store all directory information, which includes: User accounts and passwords**,** Groups and their memberships, Organizational units (OUs), Computer accounts, Security policies and permissions, Schema and configuration data, other directory objects.
- It is stored by default in the **%SystemRoot%\NTDS** folder on all domain controllers.
- It is accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols.

**Roles of a Domain Controller:**

- **User Authentication**: Validates user credentials using Kerberos or NTLM.
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Applies Group Policies, password rules, and other security settings.
- **Directory Services**: Stores AD objects (users, computers, groups) and handles queries via **LDAP**.
- **Replication**: Synchronizes directory data across multiple Domain Controllers in the network.

**Example of a DC in Action:**

- When a user **logs into a computer** in the domain, the request goes to the **Domain Controller**.
- If credentials are valid, the **DC grants access**.
- The user can now access network resources **without re-authenticating** (Single Sign-On).

**Multiple Domain Controllers:**

To improve reliability, organizations often have **multiple DCs**.

- **Primary Domain Controller (PDC)** handles critical functions.
- **Backup Domain Controllers (BDCs)** provide redundancy in case of failure.

---

### 3. Organizational Unit (OU)

An **Organizational Unit (OU)** is a **subdivision within a domain** that groups users, computers, and other objects into a **logical structure**.

**Why Use OUs?**

- Helps **organize resources** in a structured way.
- Allows for **delegated administration** (e.g., giving HR control over employee accounts).
- Facilitates **Group Policy** application at a granular level.

**Example of OU Structure:**

```
techcorp.com
├── IT Department (OU)
│   ├── Users (OU)
│   ├── Computers (OU)
│   ├── Groups (OU)
├── Sales Department (OU)
│   ├── Users (OU)
│   ├── Computers (OU)
```

- Group policies can be applied **differently for each OU**.
- The **IT department's users** might have administrative privileges, while the **Sales department's users** have restricted access.

---

### 4. Global Catalog (GC)

The **Global Catalog (GC)** is a **distributed database** that stores a **partial but searchable copy** of all objects from every domain in a **multi-domain Active Directory forest**.

**Purpose of the Global Catalog:**

- **Speeds up searches** for users, groups, and resources across different domains.
- **Facilitates authentication** in a multi-domain environment.
- **Provides a single reference point** for locating AD objects.

**How the GC Works:**

- If a user in **"techcorp.com"** needs to find a resource in **"sales.techcorp.com"**, the GC helps locate it **without directly contacting another domain controller**.

**Example Query Using the GC:**

- A user searches for **"John Doe"** in AD.
- Instead of searching every domain separately, the **GC returns results from all domains** quickly.

**Where the GC is Stored:**

- It is stored on **Domain Controllers with the Global Catalog role enabled**.
- Not every Domain Controller has to be a Global Catalog server, but having at least one per site **improves performance**.

---

### 5. Schema

The **Active Directory Schema** is the **blueprint** that defines the types of objects and attributes AD can store.

**What the Schema Defines:**

- **Object Classes**: Defines the types of objects AD can store, such as:
    - Users
    - Computers
    - Groups
    - Printers
- **Attributes**: Specifies the properties each object type can have.
    - A **User** object may have attributes like **First Name, Last Name, Email**.
    - A **Computer** object may have attributes like **Hostname, Operating System, IP Address**.

**Schema Example in AD:**

- A **User Object** in AD:
    
    ```
    CN: John Doe
    ObjectClass: user
    sAMAccountName: jdoe
    mail: john.doe@techcorp.com
    ```
    
- A **Computer Object** in AD:
    
    ```
    CN: IT-PC-01
    ObjectClass: computer
    operatingSystem: Windows 10
    ipAddress: 192.168.1.100
    ```


**Extending the Schema:**

- Organizations can **add custom attributes** to store extra information.
- Example: Adding a "Department" attribute to user objects.

**Schema Replication:**

- Schema changes are **replicated across all domain controllers**.
- Only **Schema Administrators** can modify it.

Active Directory (AD) relies on different protocols for **directory services** (managing users, groups, and resources) and **authentication** (verifying identities). They include the following:

### 1. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) – Directory Services

LDAP is a protocol used to query and modify directory information stored in Active Directory. It allows applications and services to retrieve user details, group memberships, and other directory objects.

**How LDAP Works in AD:**

- When a client (e.g., a computer, application, or service) requests directory information, it sends an **LDAP query** to a **Domain Controller (DC)**.
- The DC searches its **Active Directory database** and returns the requested data.

**LDAP Example in AD:**

- Finding a user’s email address:
    
    ```bash
    ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc.example.com -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w password -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(cn=John Doe)"
    ```
    
- Applications like **Microsoft Outlook, VPNs, and web portals** use LDAP to look up user information in AD.

---

### 2. Authentication Protocols in AD:

AD supports **Kerberos** and **NTLM** for authentication, allowing users to securely log into Windows-based systems.

**A. Kerberos (Primary Authentication Protocol in AD)**

Kerberos is a secure and efficient authentication protocol that **relies on ticketing** instead of transmitting passwords. It is used by default in modern Windows domains.

**How Kerberos Works in AD:**

1. **User logs in** → The request goes to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** (running on a Domain Controller).
2. **KDC issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** → The user receives this encrypted ticket, proving their identity.
3. **Accessing Resources** → When accessing a service (e.g., a file share), the client presents the TGT to request a **Service Ticket**.
4. **Service grants access** → If the ticket is valid, the resource allows access without needing the user’s password again (Single Sign-On).

**Why Kerberos?**

- **More secure** (uses tickets instead of passwords).
- **Supports Single Sign-On (SSO)**.
- **Prevents replay attacks** by using timestamps.

---

### B. NTLM (Older, Less Secure Authentication Protocol)

NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is an older authentication method that was used before Kerberos. It still works for **backward compatibility** but is **less secure**.

**How NTLM Works in AD:**

1. The client encrypts the user's password and sends a **challenge-response** to the server.
2. The server verifies the credentials by comparing hashes stored in AD.

 **Why NTLM is Less Secure:**

- **No ticketing system** (reuses password hashes, making it vulnerable to attacks).
- **Prone to relay attacks** (attackers can capture and reuse credentials).
- **Used only in specific cases** (e.g., non-domain-joined machines or legacy applications).


|**Protocol**|**Purpose**|**Security**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**LDAP**|Directory lookup|Not for authentication|Querying user, group, and computer info|
|**Kerberos**|Authentication (Primary)|Secure (uses tickets)|Windows logins, SSO, modern authentication|
|**NTLM**|Authentication (Legacy)|Less secure|Legacy applications, non-domain systems|

## The Purpose of Active Directory

Active Directory simplifies the administration and management of networked resources. Some of the use cases are:

1. **Centralized Resource Management**: AD allows administrators to manage all network resources from a centralized location, making it easier to maintain and secure the network.
   
2. **Improved Security**: AD enhances network security through its robust authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
   
3. **Group Policy Management**: AD allows the use of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings and operational policies across the entire network, ensuring compliance with organizational standards.
   
4. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can access multiple services and resources across the network with a single set of credentials, simplifying the user experience.
   
5. Most commonly used Identity management service across the globe.
