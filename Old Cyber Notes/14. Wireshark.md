Wireshark is one of the most powerful network traffic analyzers. It can be used to view network traffic, analyze packet data, and identify any problematic or malicious activity.

Wireshark does three things:

1. **Packet Capture:** Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
2. **Filtering:** Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
3. **Visualization:** Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

## Wireshark User Interface (GUI) Overview

When you first open Wireshark you’ll be presented with the start screen.

There are four primary areas to the start screen, some of which will carry over into the working screen once you pick an interface to work capture traffic from.

**1. The Menu**

![[wire-image1.png]]

---

**2. The Main Toolbar**

![[wire-image2.png]]

This is a quick access toolbar providing easy to use buttons for the most common functions of the main menu. Most of these buttons become active only after you’ve selected an interface to monitor.

**3. The Filter Toolbar**

---
**4. Interface List**

![[wireshark-interface-list-diagram.webp]]

The Interface List is the area where the interfaces that your device has installed will appear. Before you can see pcap capture file, packet data you need to pick one of the interfaces by clicking on it. You can choose a capture filter and type of interface to show in the interfaces lists at this screen as well.

### Wireshark Working Screen 


![[wire-image4.png]]

**2. Packet List**

Every line in this pane represents one packet. By default, the pane is broken up into 7 columns, each of which provides useful identification data for each packet and can be sorted to help you better dissect the data. You can remove, add, and reorder the columns to suit your needs. Selecting a packet will show more details in the Packet Details Pane and Packet Bytes Pane.

**4. Packet Details Pane**

When you click on a packet in the Packet List Pane it loads data about that packet in the Packet Details Pane. This pane displays the packet’s different protocols and protocol fields. This is list is displayed as a tree that can be expanded to show even more detail.


**5. Wireshark Packet Bytes Pane**

When you click on a packet in the Packet List Pane it loads data about the packet in the Packet Bytes Pane as well. This data is in a hexdump style with each line displaying the data offset, 16 hexadecimal bytes, and 16 ASCII bytes. The periods represent non-printable bytes.


**6. Wireshark Status bar**

The status bar contains informational messages.

## Analyzing Captured Data


#### Understanding Packet Information

Once you begin capturing data with Wireshark, it displays the total number of captured packets at the bottom of the screen. Initially, you will see all packets displayed but, by using filters, you can drill down to view only the important packets.

Each row on the screen represents a single packet, showcasing the exchange of information over the network during activities like browsing a website or transferring files.

### The Importance of Filtering

Your network is constantly buzzing with packet transfers, not just from your activities but also from IoT and smart devices maintaining their connection to the network. The challenge in using Wireshark lies in filtering out the noise—identifying packets that aren’t immediately relevant to your current analysis objective. Wireshark offers tools to give you a comprehensive overview of network activity, enabling you to narrow down and examine the specific packets you need to analyze further.

### Wireshark Filters for TCP 3-Way Handshake

A TCP 3-way handshake consists of three packets:

1. **SYN** – Client initiates connection
2. **SYN-ACK** – Server acknowledges
3. **ACK** – Client completes the handshake

**Wireshark Filter for Capturing the 3-Way Handshake**

```plaintext
tcp.flags.syn == 1 || tcp.flags.ack == 1
```

- Captures both `SYN` and `ACK` packets.
- Useful for monitoring new connections.

**More Specific Filters:**

**1. Capture Only SYN Packets (Connection Attempts)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x02
```

- Shows only TCP `SYN` packets.

**2. Capture Only SYN-ACK Packets (Server Responses)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x12
```

- Shows TCP `SYN-ACK` responses from the server.

**3. Capture Only Final ACK (Completion of Handshake)**

```plaintext
tcp.flags == 0x10
```

- Shows TCP `ACK` packets completing the handshake.

**4. Capture Full 3-Way Handshake for a Specific IP**

```plaintext
(ip.addr == 192.168.1.100) && (tcp.flags.syn == 1 || tcp.flags.ack == 1)
```

- Replace `192.168.1.100` with the IP of interest.

**Detecting Suspicious TCP Handshakes (Possible Scanning)**

- If you see a lot of `SYN` packets **without** `SYN-ACK`, this could indicate a **SYN flood attack**.
- Use the following filter to detect such behavior:


    ```plaintext
    tcp.flags.syn == 1 && !tcp.flags.ack == 1
    ```

### Wireshark Filters for Pentesting & Credential Capture on HTTP

#### 1. Capture Credentials in an HTTP Form

Since HTTP traffic is unencrypted, credentials sent in a form can often be captured in plaintext.

**Wireshark Display Filter:**

```plaintext
http.request.method == "POST"
```

- This captures all HTTP POST requests, where credentials are usually submitted.
- To narrow it down to login pages, look for parameters like `username`, `password`, `email`, etc.

**Additional Filter for Specific Host:**

```plaintext
http.host contains "targetwebsite.com"
```

- Replace `targetwebsite.com` with the domain you are testing.

**To View Data Inside the Packet:**

1. Right-click on a packet → Follow → HTTP Stream
   
2. Look for form parameters such as:

    ```
    username=admin&password=123456
    ```


#### 2. Other Pentesting Wireshark Filters

**a) Capture Unencrypted Passwords in HTTP Traffic**

```plaintext
http contains "password"
```

- Filters HTTP packets containing the keyword "password".

**b) Capture FTP Login Credentials (Plaintext)**

```plaintext
ftp.request.command == "USER" || ftp.request.command == "PASS"
```

- Shows usernames and passwords sent via FTP (which are in plaintext).

**c) Capture Telnet Sessions (Plaintext Credentials)**

```plaintext
telnet
```

- Filters all Telnet traffic, which transmits data in plaintext.

**d) Detect Suspicious DNS Queries (Potential C2 Communication)**

```plaintext
dns.qry.name contains "malicious.com"
```

- Replace `malicious.com` with any suspected domain.

**e) Detect ARP Spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks)**

```plaintext
arp.duplicate-address-detected
```

- Identifies duplicate IP-MAC mappings, a sign of ARP spoofing.

**f) Capture ICMP Traffic (Ping Sweeps & Network Scanning)**

```plaintext
icmp
```

- Useful for detecting reconnaissance activities.

**g) Capture Suspicious SSH Connections**

```plaintext
tcp.port == 22 && tcp.flags.push == 1
```

- Identifies SSH traffic where data is actively transmitted.

**h) Capture Traffic from a Specific IP (e.g., Attacker’s Machine)**

```plaintext
ip.src == 192.168.1.100
```

- Replace `192.168.1.100` with the attacker's IP.
