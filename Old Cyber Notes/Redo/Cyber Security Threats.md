**Cyber Threats** are potential dangers that target computer systems, networks, and data. They come in various forms such as viruses, ransomware, phishing, and spyware. These threats often aim to steal information, cause disruption, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

**Cyber Attacks** are actions carried out using these threats. Hackers may use phishing emails to trick users or launch ransomware to lock data and demand payment. To stay safe, individuals and organizations use tools like antivirus software, firewalls, and regular system updates.

## Types of Malware


Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to containing and removing them.

Below are  some of the most common types of malware:


#### Spyware

Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data, including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details. Spyware does this by modifying the security settings on your devices.

It often bundles itself with legitimate software or Trojan horses.

#### Adware

Adware is often installed with some versions of software and is designed to automatically deliver advertisements to a user, most often on a web browser. You know it when you see it! It’s hard to ignore when you’re faced with constant pop-up ads on your screen.

It is common for adware to come with spyware.

#### Backdoor

This type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a system. As a result, hackers can gain remote access to resources within an application and issue remote system commands.

A backdoor works in the background and is difficult to detect.

#### Ransomware

This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a payment is made. Ransomware usually works by encrypting your data so that you can’t access it.

Some versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock it down. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails that encourage you to download a malicious attachment or through a software vulnerability.

#### Scareware

This is a type of malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action. Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation.

If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware.

#### Rootkits

This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can then use to access your computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to gain access to resources that normally shouldn’t be accessible (privilege escalation) and modify system files.

Rootkits can also modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect. In most cases, a computer infected by a rootkit has to be wiped and any required software reinstalled.

#### Viruses

A virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to other executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code. Most viruses require end-user interaction to initiate activation and can be written to act on a specific date or time.

Viruses can be relatively harmless, such as those that display a funny image. Or they can be destructive, such as those that modify or delete data.

Viruses can also be programmed to mutate in order to avoid detection. Most viruses are spread by USB drives, optical disks, network shares or email.

#### Trojans

This malware carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent. It might appear legitimate but is, in fact, very dangerous. Trojans exploit your user privileges and are most often found in image files, audio files or games.

Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate but act as a decoy to sneak malicious software past unsuspecting users.

#### Worms

This is a type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to another. Unlike a virus, which requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection of the host, they do not require user participation and can spread very quickly over the network.

Worms share similar patterns: They exploit system vulnerabilities, they have a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain malicious code (payload) to cause damage to computer systems or networks.

Worms are responsible for some of the most devastating attacks on the Internet. In 2001, the Code Red worm had infected over 300,000 servers in just 19 hours.

#### Symptoms of Malware

Regardless of the type of malware a system has been infected with, there are some common symptoms to look out for. These include:

- an increase in central processing unit (CPU) usage, which slows down your device

- your computer freezing or crashing often

- a decrease in your web browsing speed

- unexplainable problems with your network connections

- modified or deleted files

- the presence of unknown files, programs or desktop icons

- unknown processes running

- programs turning off or reconfiguring themselves

- emails being sent without your knowledge or consent.

## Methods of Infiltration

**Infiltration** in cybersecurity refers to the act of **secretly gaining unauthorized access** to a computer system, network, or device. This is usually done by attackers with the goal of stealing data, spying, planting malware, or setting up future attacks — all without being detected.

It often starts through methods like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using malware. Once inside, the attacker may move quietly through the system, access sensitive information, or create backdoors to return later. Infiltration is a key step in many cyberattacks and can go unnoticed for a long time if the system lacks strong defenses.

### Social Engineering

Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.

**Some common types of social engineering attacks.**


**Pretexting**

This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data.

For example, pretending to need a person’s personal or financial data in order to confirm their identity.

**Tailgating**

This is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location.

**Something for something (quid pro quo)**

This is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift.

### Denial-of-Service

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.

**There two main types of DoS attacks.**

##### Overwhelming quantity of traffic  

This is when a network, host or application is sent an enormous amount of data at a rate which it cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or the device or service to crash.

##### Maliciously formatted packets  

A packet is a collection of data that flows between a source and a receiver computer or application over a network, such as the Internet. When a maliciously formatted packet is sent, the receiver will be unable to handle it.

For example, if an attacker forwards packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets that cannot be identified by an application, this will cause the receiving device to run very slowly or crash.


DoS attacks are considered a major risk because they can easily interrupt communication and cause significant loss of time and money.

---

### Distributed DoS

A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:

- An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by handler systems.
- The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
- When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.

---

### Botnet

A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.

These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.

Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify any botnet locations.

- Infected bots try to communicate with a command and control host on the Internet.

- The Cisco Firewall botnet filter is a feature that detects traffic coming from devices infected with the malicious botnet code.

- The cloud-based Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) service pushes down updated filters to the firewall that match traffic from new known botnets.

- Alerts go out to Cisco’s internal security team to notify them about the infected devices that are generating malicious traffic so that they can prevent, mitigate and remedy these.

### On-Path Attacks

On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.

This type of attack is also referred to as a **man-in-the-middle** or **man-in-the-mobile** attack.

**MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM)**  
A MITM attack happens when a cybercriminal takes control of a device without the user’s knowledge. With this level of access, an attacker can intercept and capture user information before it is sent to its intended destination. These types of attacks are often used to steal financial information. There are many types of malware that possess MITM attack capabilities.

**MAN-IN-THE-MOBILE (MITMO)**  
A variation of man-in-the-middle, MITMO is a type of attack used to take control over a user’s mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instructed to extract user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. Zitmo (ZeuS-in-the-Mobile) is one example of a malware package with MITMO capabilities. It allows attackers to quietly capture two-step verification SMS messages that are sent to users.

### SEO Poisoning

You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about improving an organization’s website so that it gains greater visibility in search engine results.

Search engines such as Google work by presenting a list of web pages to users based on their search query. These web pages are ranked according to the relevancy of their content.

### Password Attacks

Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticating to a web site. Therefore, uncovering your password is an easy way for cybercriminals to gain access to your most valuable information.

Below are some of the common password security attacks.

#### Password spraying

This technique attempts to gain access to a system by ‘spraying’ a few commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts. For example, a cybercriminal uses 'Password123' with many usernames before trying again with a second commonly-used password, such as ‘qwerty.’

This technique allows the perpetrator to remain undetected as they avoid frequent account lockouts.

#### Dictionary attacks

A hacker systematically tries every word in a dictionary or a list of commonly used words as a password in an attempt to break into a password-protected account.

#### Brute-force attacks

The simplest and most commonly used way of gaining access to a password-protected site, brute-force attacks see an attacker using all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols in the password space until they get it right.


#### Rainbow attacks

Passwords in a computer system are not stored as plain text, but as hashed values (numerical values that uniquely identify data). A rainbow table is a large dictionary of precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated.

Unlike a brute-force attack that has to calculate each hash, a rainbow attack compares the hash of a password with those stored in the rainbow table. When an attacker finds a match, they identify the password used to create the hash.

#### Traffic interception

Plain text or unencrypted passwords can be easily read by other humans and machines by intercepting communications.

If you store a password in clear, readable text, anyone who has access to your account or device, whether authorized or unauthorized, can read it.


Carrying out brute-force attacks involves the attacker trying several possible combinations in an attempt to guess the password. These attacks usually involve a word-list file — a text file containing a list of words from a dictionary. A program such as Ophcrack, L0phtCrack, THC Hydra, RainbowCrack or Medusa will then try each word and common combinations until it finds a match.

Because brute-force attacks take time, complex passwords take much longer to guess.


### Advanced Persistent Threats

Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.

Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually well-funded and typically targets organizations or nations for business or political reasons.

Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain there undetected.

## Security Vulnerability and Exploits

**Security vulnerabilities** are any kind of software or hardware defect. 

A program written to take advantage of a known vulnerability is referred to as an **exploit**. 

A cybercriminal can use an exploit against a vulnerability to carry out an attack, the goal of which is to gain access to a system, the data it hosts or a specific resource.

### Hardware Vulnerabilities

Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. For example, the type of memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component which can hold an electrical charge) installed very close to one another. However, it was soon discovered that, due to their close proximity, changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor capacitors. Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer was created. By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM.

Hardware vulnerabilities are specific to device models and are not generally exploited through random compromising attempts. While hardware exploits are more common in highly targeted attacks, traditional malware protection and good physical security are sufficient protection for the everyday user.

### Software Vulnerabilities

Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code.

Most software security vulnerabilities fall into several main categories.

#### Buffer overflow

Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, the application can access memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash or data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges.

#### Non-validated input

Programs often require data input, but this incoming data could have malicious content, designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way.

For example, consider a program that receives an image for processing. A malicious user could craft an image file with invalid image dimensions. The maliciously crafted dimensions could force the program to allocate buffers of incorrect and unexpected sizes.

#### Race conditions

This vulnerability describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or at the proper time.


#### Weaknesses in security practices

Systems and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication, authorization and encryption. Developers should stick to using security techniques and libraries that have already been created, tested and verified and should not attempt to create their own security algorithms. These will only likely introduce new vulnerabilities.


#### Access control problems

Access control is the process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or change the file. Many security vulnerabilities are created by the improper use of access controls.

Nearly all access controls and security practices can be overcome if an attacker has physical access to target equipment. For example, no matter the permission settings on a file, a hacker can bypass the operating system and read the data directly off the disk. Therefore, to protect the machine and the data it contains, physical access must be restricted, and encryption techniques must be used to protect data from being stolen or corrupted.


---

### Software Updates

The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities. Microsoft, Apple and other operating system producers release patches and updates almost every day and applications such as web browsers, mobile apps and web servers are often updated by the companies or organizations responsible for them.

Despite the fact that organizations put a lot of effort into finding and patching software vulnerabilities, new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. That’s why some organizations use third party security researchers who specialize in finding vulnerabilities in software, or actually invest in their own penetration testing teams dedicated to search, find and patch software vulnerabilities before they can get exploited.

Google’s Project Zero is a great example of this practice. After discovering a number of vulnerabilities in various software used by end users, Google formed a permanent team dedicated to finding software vulnerabilities.

## The Cybersecurity Landscape

The **Cybersecurity Landscape** refers to the overall state of cybersecurity, including the **threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and defense strategies** that exist at a given time. It's like a map of the current environment in which cybersecurity activities occur.


### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is digital money that can be used to buy goods and services, using strong encryption techniques to secure online transactions. 

Banks, governments and even companies like Microsoft and AT&T are very aware of its importance and are jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon!

Cryptocurrency owners keep their money in encrypted, virtual ‘wallets.’ When a transaction takes place between the owners of two digital wallets, the details are recorded in a decentralized, electronic ledger or blockchain system. 

This means it is carried out with a degree of anonymity and is self-managed, with no interference from third parties such as central banks or government entities.

Approximately every ten minutes, special computers collect data about the latest cryptocurrency transactions, turning them into mathematical puzzles to maintain confidentiality.

These transactions are then verified through a technical and highly complex process known as ‘mining.’ This step typically involves an army of ‘miners’ working on high-end PCs to solve mathematical puzzles and authenticate transactions.

Once verified, the ledger is updated and electronically copied and disseminated worldwide to anyone belonging to the blockchain network, effectively completing a transaction.


### Cryptojacking

Cryptojacking is an emerging threat that hides on a user’s computer, mobile phone, tablet, laptop or server, using that machine’s resources to 'mine’ cryptocurrencies without the user's consent or knowledge.

Many victims of cryptojacking didn’t even know they’d been hacked until it was too late!

It’s clear that the cyber landscape is changing. And while the rise of cryptocurrency has produced lots of opportunity, it also exposes more vulnerabilities, making it easier than ever before for hackers to steal huge sums of money online.
