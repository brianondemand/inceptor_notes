**WLAN** stands for **Wireless Local Area Network**. WLAN is a local area network that uses radio communication to provide mobility to the network users while maintaining the connectivity to the wired network. 

A WLAN basically, extends a wired local area network. WLAN’s are built by attaching a device called the access point(AP) to the edge of the wired network. Clients communicate with the AP using a wireless network adapter which is similar in function to an ethernet adapter. It is also called a LAWN is a Local area wireless network. 

## The Evolution of Wi-Fi Technology and Standards


**The Evolution of Wi-Fi Technology and Standards**

Wi-Fi technology has evolved significantly since its inception, transforming the way people connect to the internet and communicate wirelessly. From the early days of slow and unreliable connections to today's high-speed, low-latency networks, Wi-Fi has become an essential component of modern life. This document explores the history, development, and future trends of Wi-Fi technology and standards.

## 802.11 Standard

The **802.11 standard** is a set of wireless networking protocols developed by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** for implementing wireless local area networks (**WLANs**). It defines how devices communicate over wireless signals, allowing for wireless internet access in homes, offices, and public places.

## Wireless Security Protocols

Wireless networks require security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. The **802.11 standard** includes various security protocols to protect wireless communications. The most common ones are **WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3**.

### 1. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) – 1997 (Weak Security)

**WEP** was the first security protocol introduced with **802.11 in 1997**. It was designed to provide **confidentiality** similar to wired networks.

**Features of WEP**

- Uses **RC4 encryption** with **40-bit or 104-bit keys**.
- Authentication: **Open System** or **Shared Key**.
- Each device shares the same **static key** for encryption.
- Uses **Integrity Check Value (ICV)** to detect changes in data.

**Weaknesses of WEP**

- Easily hackable due to weak encryption and predictable key patterns.
- Key reuse vulnerability makes cracking the encryption easy.
- No proper authentication mechanism, making it prone to attacks.

**Example Attack**

An attacker can use **Aircrack-ng** to capture enough packets and break a **WEP** key in minutes.

**Verdict:** WEP is obsolete and should NOT be used.


### 2. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) – 2003 (Temporary Fix)

After WEP was proven insecure, **WPA** was introduced as an **interim solution** until a stronger security protocol could be developed.

**Features of WPA**

- Uses **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)** to dynamically change encryption keys.
- Still based on **RC4 encryption**, but with better key handling.
- Introduced **Message Integrity Check (MIC)** to detect packet tampering.
- Supported **802.1X authentication** for enterprise networks.

**Weaknesses of WPA**

- Still vulnerable to **offline dictionary attacks**.
- TKIP can be cracked with tools like **aircrack-ng**.
- Less secure than its successor, **WPA2**.

**Example Attack**

A hacker can capture WPA-TKIP handshake packets and use **brute-force attacks** to crack weak passwords.

**Verdict:** WPA is better than WEP but still insecure.


## 3. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) – 2004 (Strong Security)

**WPA2** replaced WPA and became the standard for **secure Wi-Fi encryption**.

**Features of WPA2**

- Uses **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-CCMP)** instead of RC4.
- Supports **Pre-Shared Key (WPA2-PSK)** for home users.
- Supports **Enterprise mode (WPA2-Enterprise)** with **802.1X authentication**.
- Strong encryption with **128-bit AES**.

**Weaknesses of WPA2**

- Vulnerable to **brute-force attacks** if a weak password is used.
- **KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack)** can be used to decrypt WPA2 traffic.
- Public networks using **WPA2-PSK** are still risky without extra protections like **VPNs**.

**Example Attack**

A hacker can use **KRACK attacks** to force a client to reinstall encryption keys, allowing packet decryption.

**Verdict:** WPA2 is secure for most use cases but should be combined with strong passwords and firmware updates.


## 4. WPA3 – 2018 (The Latest & Most Secure)

**WPA3** is the latest security protocol, improving security for modern Wi-Fi networks.

**Features of WPA3**

- Uses **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** instead of **PSK**, making password attacks much harder.
- Introduces **Forward Secrecy**, meaning past data remains safe even if a key is compromised.
- Stronger encryption (192-bit in Enterprise mode).
- Protection against **brute-force attacks**.

**Weaknesses of WPA3**

- Not all devices support WPA3 yet.
- **Downgrade attacks** could force devices to use WPA2 instead.
- Some vulnerabilities still exist, like **Dragonblood attacks**.

**Example Attack**

Older WPA3 implementations were vulnerable to **Dragonblood attacks**, but updates have fixed this issue.

**Verdict:** WPA3 is currently the best security option for Wi-Fi networks.

## Access Point (AP)

An **Access Point (AP)** is a networking device that allows **wireless devices** (laptops, smartphones, IoT devices) to connect to a **wired network** via **Wi-Fi**. It acts as a bridge between **wired Ethernet networks** and **wireless clients**.

**Types of Access Points:**

1. **Standalone APs** – Typically used in **homes and small offices**, integrated into routers.
2. **Enterprise APs** – Managed through a **central controller** in businesses.
3. **Mesh APs** – Multiple APs working together for **wide coverage** (e.g., Google Nest Wi-Fi).
4. **Outdoor APs** – Designed for **public hotspots** and large outdoor areas.


### Common Attacks on Access Points

Attackers often target **Wi-Fi access points** to gain unauthorized access, intercept data, or disrupt network services. Below are common **wireless attacks** and how they work.

### (A) Rogue Access Point Attack

A **Rogue AP** is an **unauthorized wireless access point** connected to a network. Attackers set these up to **steal data or perform MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks**.

**How It Works:**

1. Attacker installs a **fake access point** inside a company or public network.
2. Devices unknowingly connect to the rogue AP.
3. Attacker intercepts **passwords, emails, and other sensitive data**.

**Prevention:**

- Use **Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS)**.
- Disable **unauthorized APs** in the network.
- Regularly **scan for rogue APs**.

### (B) Evil Twin Attack

An **Evil Twin** is a malicious AP that **mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network** to trick users into connecting.

**How It Works:**

1. Attacker sets up a Wi-Fi network **with the same SSID** (e.g., `Starbucks_WiFi`).
2. Victims connect, thinking it's a **legitimate network**.
3. All **traffic is intercepted**, allowing the attacker to steal login credentials.

**Prevention:**

- **Verify SSID before connecting** to public Wi-Fi.
- Use **VPN** to encrypt network traffic.
- Enable **WPA3 authentication** to prevent forced connections.


### (C) Deauthentication Attack (Wi-Fi Jamming)

This attack **disconnects users** from a Wi-Fi network by **spoofing deauthentication packets**.

**How It Works:**

1. Attacker uses tools like **aircrack-ng** or **MDK3**.
2. Sends **deauth frames** to a victim's device.
3. Device is **forced to reconnect**, allowing attackers to capture WPA handshakes.

**Prevention:**

- Use **802.11w** (Management Frame Protection).
- Set **WPA3 encryption**.
- Use **MAC filtering** (not foolproof but adds difficulty).


### (D) Packet Sniffing (Eavesdropping)

Attackers **monitor and capture Wi-Fi traffic** using tools like **Wireshark**.

**How It Works:**

1. Attacker connects to an **open or weakly secured Wi-Fi**.
2. Uses packet sniffing tools to **capture unencrypted data**.
3. Sensitive information like **usernames, passwords, and emails** can be stolen.

**Prevention:**

- **Use WPA3 encryption** to prevent traffic interception.
- Avoid **connecting to open Wi-Fi networks**.
- Use **HTTPS and VPNs** for secure browsing.


### (E) Brute-Force Attacks on Wi-Fi Passwords

Attackers try to **crack the Wi-Fi password** by running millions of guesses (dictionary attack).

**How It Works:**

1. Captures **WPA handshake** from a user connecting.
2. Uses tools like **Aircrack-ng, Hashcat, or Wifite**.
3. Tries different password combinations until it finds the correct one.

**Prevention:**

- Set a **strong password (12+ characters, mix of symbols and numbers)**.
- Disable **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)** to prevent PIN brute-force attacks.
- Use **WPA3 or WPA2-AES**.


### (F) Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

An attacker **intercepts communication** between a device and an access point.

**How It Works:**

1. Uses **ARP spoofing** to redirect traffic through the attacker's system.
2. Captures sensitive data like **login credentials**.
3. Can modify **webpages and inject malware**.

**Prevention:**

- Use **HTTPS and VPN** for secure browsing.
- Enable **firewalls and IDS/IPS**.
- Use **MAC address filtering** to limit connections.

## Service Set Identifier (SSID)

A service set identifier (SSID) is a unique identifier that allows devices to connect to a Wi-Fi network. The SSID differentiates between multiple Wi-Fi networks in an area so users can connect to the right one. For example, at a coffee shop, the SSID might be something like "Coffee Shop Wi-Fi."

The SSID is broadcast by the router or access point (AP) and is sent out in what is called a "beacon." The beacon is a special type of management frame in IEEE 802.11-based wireless local-area networks (WLANs) and is transferred at regular intervals by the router. Any device within range of the beacon can see the SSID.

When connecting to a wireless network, a computer will look for the SSID, and once it finds it, it will then attempt to connect to the network using the password provided.

#### SSID vs BSSID vs ESSID

SSID, basic service set identifier (BSSID), and extended service set identifier (ESSID) describe sections of a wireless network and can all be used to identify a particular network. Although they may sound similar, they each have different meanings.

1. **BSSID:** BSSID is typically the Media access control (MAC) address of the wireless access point (WAP) or router providing the wireless network.
2. **SSID:** SSID is the name of a particular wireless network and is typically included in the beacon frames that are broadcast by the WAP or router.
3. **ESSID:** ESSID is typically included in the probe request and probe response frames that are exchanged between devices on the network.

### How SSID Is Used In Cyberattacks

An SSID can be used by hackers to launch a cyberattack in several ways, such as:

1. **Impersonate a legitimate network and trick users into connecting to it:** Once connected, the hacker can then intercept and collect data passing through the network.
2. **Brute force** **their way into a network:** By trying to connect with different passwords, they can eventually find the right one and gain access to the network.
3. **Launch a** **denial-of-service (DoS) attack**: In this type of attack, the hacker sends a large number of requests to the WAP. This overloads the WAP and prevents legitimate users from connecting to the network.

### SSID Security

Here are some measures to secure your SSID:

1. **Use WPA2 encryption:** Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) is the most current and secure form of wireless encryption, so make sure your router is using it. If your router is using an older form of encryption, like Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), malicious actors can more easily gain access to your network.
   
2. **Use a strong password:** To access your wireless network, users need to know the password. Therefore, use a strong, difficult-to-guess password that is at least eight characters long and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
   
3. **Enable Media access control (MAC)** **filtering:** MAC filtering is a feature that allows users to specify which devices can connect to a wireless network. By only allowing access to known devices, you can keep out anyone who should not be there.
   
4. **Keep your router up to date:** Like any other piece of technology, it is important to keep your router up to date with the latest firmware. Router manufacturers regularly release updates that can help improve security and fix any known vulnerabilities, so always check for updates and install them as soon as they are available.

## Attacking Wireless Networks

**Access Point:** The point where the mobile device, computers connect to the wireless network.

**SSID:** Service Set Identifier identifies the access point, it is a human-readable text which when broadcasted leads to the identification of an access point. 

**BSSID**: Mac address of the Access point.

**Bandwidth**: Amount of information that can be transferred over the connection.

There are various standards for wireless transmission:

### Authentication:

#### Open Authentication:

When a client wants to connect to an open access point he/she sends a probe request, and the AP sends a probe response; the client then sends an authentication request. Upon receiving a response, the client establishes an association with the AP.

![][https://cdn.networklessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wireless-open-authentication.png]

---
#### Shared Key Authentication Process:

Here, the client sends a probe request, and the access point sends the probe response; then, the client requests for an authentication request, the AP sends an authentication challenge to the client. The client needs to send the shared key as authentication challenge response. AP, then, verifies the client and authenticates him/her, who then establishes a connection with the access point.

![][https://mrncciew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cwsp-wep-8.png]

---
#### Centralised Authentication:

In the corporate environment, instead of an Access point verifying client’s authentication details, a centralised server does the job of verifying the client. RADIUS is a centralised authentication server which verifies clients who want to connect with the access point.

## Capturing and Cracking WPA/WPA2 WiFi Passwords (Practical Session)

Understanding the techniques used by threat actors to capture and crack WPA/WPA2 hashes can be also be useful when trying to enhance your network security.

**Capturing WPA/WPA2 Pre-Shared Key Hashes**

1. **Kill Running Processes:** To begin, you must ensure that any running networking services on your machine are killed. This shuts down any services that may prevent airmon-ng placing the wireless network interface card (NIC) in monitor mode. The following command must be run from the airmon-ng suite.

```
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

2. **Monitor Mode Activation: Y**our wireless NIC must be set to monitor mode. This mode allows the NIC to monitor and capture all wireless traffic within range. We recommend using a wireless adapter that will support packet injection and monitor mode. The wireless adapters will also provide much better signal reception over a built-in wireless NIC.

```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

3. **Packet Sniffing:** Once in monitor mode, a tool such as airodump-ng can be employed to capture incoming wireless packets. The tool provides a real-time view of the wireless networks in range (SSIDs) and their access point MAC addresses (BSSIDs). We use the following command, focusing on the wlan0 interface in our case.

```
sudo airodump-ng ‘wlan0mon’
```

4. **Targeted Capture:** To reduce the noise and focus on the target we are interested in, we can set airodump to filter by the relevant BSSID and channel. Where there are multiple BSSIDs, try to focus on one which has a higher amount of data reported.

We now wait until a WPA/WPA2 handshake is captured. Once captured there will be a banner at the top of the panel which reads ‘ WPA Handshake: `<MAC Address>` ’. Once the handshake has been obtained, we can stop the tool and collect the `.pcap` file that’s been generated (which now holds the captured WPA/WPA2 handshake).

```
sudo airodump-ng -c 4 –bssid ‘60:A4:B7:49:D9:ED’ -w capture ‘wlan0mon’
```

5. **Deauthentication Attack (Optional):** Where you’re having trouble capturing a wireless handshake, you can use a deauthentication attack to expedite the process. By disconnecting a client from the network, you force them to reconnect. This increases your chance of capturing a WPA/WPA2 handshake, particularly where wireless traffic is sparse.

```
sudo aireplay-ng –deauth 0 -a ‘Access point BSSID’ -c ‘Station BSSID’ ‘wlan0’
```

#### Cracking WPA/WPA2 Pre-Shared Key Hashes

**Handshake Cracking:** Now that we’ve captured a WPA/WPA2 PSK hash, we can use a tool like aircrack-ng to crack the hash and derive the plaintext password/PSK. This involves running the hash against a common password list.

For this example, I created a .txt file and entered a few lines which included the password for the router. Normally this process would require millions of potential passwords and would take significantly more computing resource and time. The simpler or easier to guess the password is, the higher the likelihood that we’ll get a password match within our list.

```
sudo aircrack-ng -w ‘wordlist.txt’ ‘capture-01.cap’
```
