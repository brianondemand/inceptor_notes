### 1\. Analogue Computer

Analogue Computer are designed to **process analogue data**. Analogue data is continuous data that changes continuously. Analogue computer is used to process data that is continuous and cannot have discrete values. We can say that analogue computer are used where we don't need exact values always such as **speed**, **temperature**, **pressure** and **current**.

Analogue Computer directly accept the data from the measurings device without first converting it into numbers and codes. They measure the continuous changes in physical quantity and generally render output as reading on a dial or scale. **Speedometer** and **mercury thermometer** are examples of Analogue Computer.

#### Types of analogue Computer

- **Slide Rules**
- **Differential Analyzer**
- **Castle Clock**
- **Electronic Analogue Computer**

### 2\. Digital Computer

Digital Computer is designed to perform calculations and logical operations at high speed. it accepts the raw data as input in the form of digit or binary numbers (0 and 1) and processes it with programs stored in its memory to produce the output. All modern computer like laptop, desktops including smartphones that we use at home or office are digital computers.

### 3\. Hybrid Computer

Hybrid computer has features of both analogue and digital computer. It is **fast like an analogue** computer and has memory and **accuracy like digital computers**. It can process both continuous and discrete data. It accepts analogue signals and convert them into digital form before processing. So it is widely used in specialized applications where both analogue and digital data is processed. For example, a processor is used in petrol pumps that converts the measurements of fuel flow into quantity and price. Similarly, they are used in airplanes, hospitals, and scientific applications.

## On the basis of SIZE

There are five types of computers:

1. supercomputer
2. Mainframe computer
3. Miniframe / MiniComputer
4. Workstation
5. Microcomputer

### 1\. Supercomputer

Supercomputer are the **biggest and fastest computers**. They are designed to process huge amount of data. A supercomputer can **trillions of instructions in a second**. It has thousand of interconnected processors.

Supercomputer are particularly used in **scientific and engineering applications** such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations and nuclear energy research. The first supercomputer was developed by **Roger Cray** in the year 1976.

#### Characteristics

- It has the ability to decrypt your password to enhance protection for security reasons.
- It produces excellent results in animations.
- It is used for virtual testing of nuclear weapons and critical medical tests.
- It can study and understand climate patterns and forcast weather conditions. It can run in NOAA's system (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that can execute any type of simple and logical data.
- It helps in designing the flight simulators for pilots at the beginner level for their training.
- It helps in extracting useful information from data storage centres or cloud systems.
- It has played a vital role in managing the online currency world such as stock market and bitcoin.
- It helps in the diagnosis of various critical diseases and in producing accurate result in brain injuries, etc.
- It helps in scientific research areas by accurately analyzing data obtained from exploring the solar system, satellite and movement of Earth.
- It also used in smog control system where it predicts the level of fog and other pollutants in the atmosphere.

### 2\. Mainframe computer

Mainframe computer are designed to **support hundred or thousand of users simultaneously**. They can **support multiple programs** at the same time. It means they can execute different processes simultaneously. These features of mainframe computers make them ideal for big organizations like banking and telecom sectors, which need to manage and process high volume of data.

#### Characteristics

- It can process huge ammount of data, e.g. millions of transactions in a second in the banking sector.
- It has very long life. It can run smoothly for up to 50 years after proper installation.
- It gives excellent performance with large scale memory management.
- It has the ability to shere or distribute its workload among other processors and input/output terminal.
- There are fewer chances of error or bugs during processing in mainframe computers. If any error occurs it can fix it quickly without affecting the performance.
- It has the ability to protect the stored data and other ongoing exchange of information and data.

### 3\. Miniframe / MiniComputer

It is a **midsize multiprocessing computer**. It consist of two or more processors and can support **4 to 200 users at one time**. Miniframe computer are used in institutes and departments for tasks such as billing, accounting and niventory management. A minicompiler **lies between the mainframe and microcomputer** as it is smaller than mainframe but larger than a microcomputer.

#### Characteristics

- It is light weight that makes it easy to carry and fit anywhere.
- It is less expensive than mainframe computer.
- It is very fast compared to its size.
- It remains charged for long time.
- It does not require a controlled operational environment.

### 4\. Workstation

Workstation is a **single user computer** that is designed for **technical or scientific applications**. It has a faster microprocessor, a large amount of RAM and high speed graphic adapters. It generally **perform a specific job with great expertise:** accordingly, they are of different types of such as graphics workstations, music workstations, and enginearing design workstations.

#### Characteristics

- It is a high-performance computer system designed for single user for bussiness or professional use.
- It has larger storage capacity, better graphics, and more powerfull CPU than a personal computer.
- It can handle animations, data analysis, CAD, audio and video creation and editing.

### 5\. Microcomputer

Microcomputer is also known as a personal computer. It is general-perpose computer that is designed for individual use. It has a microprocessor as a central processing unit, memory, storage area, input unit and output unit. Laptops and desktop computers are examples of microcomputers. They are suitable for personal work that may be making an assignment, watching a movie or at office for office work.

#### Characteristics

- It is the smallest in size among all types of computers.
- A limited number of software can be used.
- It is designed for personal work and applications. Only once user can work at a time.
- It is less expensive and easy to use.
- It does not require the user to have special skills or training to use it.
- Generally, comes with single semiconductor chip.
- It is capable of multitasking such as printing, scanning, browsing, watching videos etc.
