## The Three Levels Of Protection


## 1. Personal Protection

On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices.

Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both **offline** and **online**.

**offline identity**

Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life, including your full name, age and address.

**online identity**

Your online identity is not just a name. It’s who you are and how you present yourself to others online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites.

Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online identity.

When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information. 

Some other useful tips to help you generate your username:

- Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
- Don’t use your email username.
- Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
- Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
- Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters, the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
- Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.

Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends.

Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.

**Types of Personal data**

1. Medical Records
2. Education records
3. Employment and financial records

### Where Is Your Data?

- Shared Photos on social media: The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your photos.
  
- Medical records: For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at the insurance company.
  
  - Purchasing products online: Store loyalty cards may be a convenient way to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners.

- Smart Devices: But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate information about you.

Social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course, these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data with their marketing partners.

### Who Else Wants My Data?

It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data.

**Internet service provider (ISP)**

Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to advertisers for a profit.

In certain circumstances, ISPs may be legally required to share your information with government surveillance agencies or authorities.

**Advertisers**

Targeted advertising is part of the Internet experience. Advertisers monitor and track your online activities such as shopping habits and personal preferences and send targeted ads your way.

**Search engines and social media platforms**

These platforms gather information about your gender, geolocation, phone number and political and religious ideologies based on your search histories and online identity. This information is then sold to advertisers for a profit.

**Websites you visit**

Websites use cookies to track your activities in order to provide a more personalized experience. But this leaves a data trail that is linked to your online identity that can often end up in the hands of advertisers!

## 2. Organizational Protection

At an organizational level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data and customers.

Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know there are two main types of data that you should be aware of.

#### Types of Organizational Data

#### 1. Traditional data

Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:

- **Transactional data** such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
- **Intellectual property** such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
- **Financial data** such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

#### 2. Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data

IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'

Organizations need to invest in improved security practices.

This might include:

- investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
- enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
- maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
- storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
- separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
- granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.



---
#### 3. Government Protection

As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

---


## Cyber Security Fundamentals 
 
#### 1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems.


- **Confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include **data encryption**, **identity proofing** and **two factor authentication**.
  
- **Integrity** ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a **hash function** or **checksum**.
  
- **Availability** means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by **maintaining equipment**, **performing hardware repairs**, **keeping operating systems and software up to date**, and **creating backups**.
  
#### 2. The protection of information in each of its possible states

- **Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).
  
- **Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).
  
- **Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

#### 3. The security measures used to protect data

- **Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
  
- **Technology** refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.
  
- **Policy and procedure** refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.

## Cyber Attackers

Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain.

#### 1. Amateurs

The term 'script kiddies' emerged in the 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. While script kiddies may use basic tools, their attacks can still have devastating consequences.

#### 2. Hackers

This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.

- **White hat attackers** break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
  
- **Gray hat attackers** may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
  
- **Black hat attackers** take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.


#### 3. Organized hackers

These attackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers. They are usually highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals.

Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness about issues that are important to them.

State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. They are usually highly trained and well-funded and their attacks are focused on specific goals that are beneficial to their government.

---

## Internal and External Threats

Cyber attacks can originate from within an organization as well as from outside of it.

#### Internal

Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally:

- mishandle confidential data

- facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization’s computer system

- invite malware onto the organization’s network by clicking on malicious emails or websites

- threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices.

#### External

Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:

- exploit vulnerabilities in the network

- gain unauthorized access to computing devices

- use social engineering to gain unauthorized access to organizational data.

---

## Cyberwarfare

Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.

#### The Purpose of Cyberwarfare

The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.

how are cyberwarfare is used: 

**To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets**

A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government.

**To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets**

A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government.


Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt its commerce, and cause its citizens to lose faith and confidence in their government without the attacker ever physically setting foot in the targeted country.

Cyberwarfare is a very serious issue with potentially devastating consequences, and attacks are becoming more widespread. Now, more than ever, nations and governments need cybersecurity professionals to help protect their citizens and infrastructure.

## Defensive Security

It is concerned with two main tasks:

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

A _Security Operations Center_ (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

- Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is unavailable, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is vital to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.
  
- Policy violations: A security policy is a set of rules required to protect the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users upload confidential company data to an online storage service.
  
- Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user’s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC must detect and block such an event as soon as possible before further damage is done.
  
- Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.


#### Threat Intelligence

In this context, _intelligence_ refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A _threat_ is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. 

The purpose would be to achieve a _threat-informed defence_. Different companies have different adversaries. Some adversaries might seek to steal customer data from a mobile operator; however, other adversaries are interested in halting the production in a petroleum refinery. 

Example adversaries include a nation-state cyber army working for political reasons and a ransomware group acting for financial purposes. Based on the company (target), we can expect adversaries.


Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data is collected from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Data processing arranges it into a format suitable for analysis. The analysis phase seeks to find more information about the attackers and their motives; moreover, it aims to create a list of recommendations and actionable steps.

Learning about your adversaries lets you know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary) and predict their activity. Consequently, we can mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.



### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

This section is about Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), and we will cover:

- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis

#### Digital Forensics

Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts. With the use and spread of digital systems, such as computers and smartphones, a new branch of forensics was born to investigate related crimes: computer forensics, which later evolved into _digital forensics_.

In defensive security, the focus of digital forensics shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content. Consequently, digital forensics will focus on different areas, such as:

- **File System**: Analyzing a digital forensics image (low-level copy) of a system’s storage reveals much information, such as installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files.
  
- **System memory**: If the attacker runs their malicious program in memory without saving it to the disk, taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of the system memory is the best way to analyze its contents and learn about the attack.
- 
- **System logs**: Each client and server computer maintains different log files about what is happening. Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
  
- **Network logs**: Logs of the network packets that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails.

#### Incident Response

An _incident_ usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation. Examples of a cyber attack include an attacker making our network or systems inaccessible, defacing (changing) the public website, and data breach (stealing company data). How would you _respond_ to a cyber attack? Incident response specifies the methodology that should be followed to handle such a case. The aim is to reduce damage and recover in the shortest time possible. Ideally, you would develop a plan that is ready for incident response.

The four major phases of the incident response process are:

1. Preparation: This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures are put in place to prevent incidents from happening in the first place.
   
2. Detection and Analysis: The team has the necessary resources to detect any incident; moreover, it is essential to analyze any detected incident further to learn about its severity.
   
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems, eliminate it, and recover the affected systems. For instance, when we notice that a system is infected with a computer virus, we would like to stop (contain) the virus from spreading to other systems, clean (eradicate) the virus, and ensure proper system recovery.
   
4. Post-Incident Activity: After a successful recovery, a report is produced, and the lesson learned is shared to prevent similar future incidents.

#### Malware Analysis

Malware stands for malicious software. _Software_ refers to programs, documents, and files you can save on a disk or send over the network. Malware includes many types, such as:

- A virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another and works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.
- Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.
- Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a “ransom.”

Malware analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means:

1. Static analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. This usually requires solid knowledge of assembly language (the processor’s instruction set, i.e., the computer’s fundamental instructions).
2. Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets you observe how the malware behaves when running.


## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 

A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool is a software solution that collects and analyzes data from several sources across an organization’s digital systems in real time in order to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents. It provides a centralized platform for security event monitoring, alerting, and management.

**Importance of SIEM**

SIEM is crucial for modern cybersecurity because it offers a centralized view of an organization’s security posture. By aggregating data from various sources and applying advanced analytics, SIEM solutions enable organizations to detect and respond to threats more effectively. This centralized approach enhances the ability to identify suspicious activities, investigate incidents, and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Key Features of SIEM Solutions

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions provide a comprehensive approach to detecting and responding to security threats within an organization’s IT infrastructure:

**1. Real-time Monitoring**

One of the most significant features of SIEM is real-time monitoring. SIEM solutions continuously monitor network traffic, system logs, and user activities to detect potential security threats as they occur. This immediate visibility allows organizations to respond quickly to mitigate risks.

**2. Data Aggregation**

SIEM solutions aggregate data from diverse sources such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, servers, applications, and databases. By collecting and centralizing this information, SIEM provides a comprehensive view of the security landscape, enabling better analysis and decision-making.

**3. Correlation and Analysis**

Advanced correlation and analysis capabilities are at the heart of SIEM solutions. These features allow SIEM to identify patterns and relationships between different security events. By correlating data across multiple sources, SIEM can detect complex attack vectors that might go unnoticed by standalone security tools.

**4. Incident Response**

SIEM solutions automate incident response processes by generating alerts for suspicious activities and potential threats. These alerts are prioritized based on severity, enabling security teams to focus on the most critical issues. Automated responses, such as isolating affected systems, can also be configured to minimize the impact of incidents.

**5. Compliance Reporting**

Many organizations are concerned about regulatory compliance. SIEM solutions simplify compliance reporting by providing pre-built templates and dashboards that map security events to regulatory requirements. This helps organizations demonstrate adherence to standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

### Benefits of Implementing SIEM

Implementing a SIEM solution can significantly enhance an organization’s security posture. Following are the benefits of implementing a SIEM solution:

- **Enhanced Threat Detection:** Implementing SIEM enhances an organization’s ability to detect threats. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning, SIEM solutions can identify anomalies and indicators of compromise that traditional security tools might miss. This proactive approach improves the overall security posture.
- **Centralized View:** SIEM provides a centralized view of the security environment, consolidating data from various sources into a single pane of glass. This holistic perspective enables security teams to detect patterns and trends more effectively, facilitating quicker and more informed decision-making.
- **Reduced Response Time:** With SIEM’s real-time monitoring and automated incident response capabilities, organizations can significantly reduce their response time to security incidents. Faster detection and response help mitigate the impact of breaches, minimizing potential damage and downtime.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** SIEM solutions streamline the process of achieving and maintaining regulatory compliance. By automating data collection, analysis, and reporting, SIEM helps organizations meet the requirements of various regulations and standards, reducing the risk of fines and penalties.

### How SIEM Works

Understanding the operational mechanisms of SIEM solutions is crucial for leveraging their full potential in your cybersecurity strategy. Here’s how it works:

**1. Data Collection**

The first step in the SIEM process is data collection. SIEM solutions gather logs and data from various sources, including network devices, servers, applications, and security tools. This comprehensive data collection provides the foundation for effective threat detection and analysis.

**2. Normalization**

Once data is collected, SIEM solutions normalize it by converting it into a consistent format. This standardization is essential for accurate analysis and correlation, as it seamlessly allows SIEM to compare and contrast data from different sources.

**3. Correlation**

Correlation is the process of identifying relationships between different data points. SIEM solutions use correlation rules and algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies that indicate potential security threats. By correlating data across multiple sources, SIEM can uncover complex attack vectors and reduce false positives.

**4. Alerting**

When SIEM identifies suspicious activities or potential threats, it generates alerts. These alerts are prioritized based on severity and impact, ensuring that security teams focus on the most critical issues first. SIEM solutions often include automated response capabilities, such as isolating affected systems or blocking malicious traffic.

**5. Forensic Analysis**

SIEM solutions provide powerful forensic analysis tools in the event of a security incident. These tools enable security teams to investigate the root cause of incidents, trace the attack vector, and gather evidence for further action. Forensic analysis is essential for understanding the scope and impact of breaches and improving future defenses.

### Choosing the Right SIEM Solution

Selecting the appropriate SIEM solution for your organization involves careful consideration of following factors:

- **Scalability:** Scalability is a crucial factor when choosing a SIEM solution. As organizations grow, their security needs evolve, and the SIEM solution must be able to scale accordingly. This includes handling increased data volumes and supporting additional data sources without compromising performance.
  
- **Integration:** Compatibility with existing systems is essential for seamless SIEM implementation. The SIEM solution should integrate smoothly with the organization’s IT infrastructure, including security tools, network devices, and applications, ensuring comprehensive data collection and analysis.
  
- **Ease of Use:** A user-friendly interface and intuitive features are important for the effective use of SIEM solutions. Security teams should be able to navigate the SIEM platform easily, configure rules, and generate reports without extensive training or technical expertise.
  
- **Cost Considerations:** Balancing features with budget constraints is critical to choosing a SIEM solution. Organizations should consider the total cost of ownership, including licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance expenses. It is important to choose a solution that provides the best value for the investment.
  
- **Vendor Support:** Reliable vendor support is essential for successfully implementing and operating SIEM solutions. Organizations should evaluate the vendor’s reputation, availability of support resources, and commitment to providing timely updates and patches. Strong vendor support ensures that the SIEM solution remains effective and up-to-date.
