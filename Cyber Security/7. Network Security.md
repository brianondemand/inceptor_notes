Network security comprises of the measures adopted to protect the resources and integrity of a computer network.

A network typically holds many applications, some which holds simple logins and others with complex functionality. One way to gain an overview of the attack surface, and also map out easy to exploit vulnerabilities, is to port scan all the assets in the target environment, then screenshot them.

Network Scanning  is a network exploration technique used to identify the systems connected to an organization’s network. It provides information about the accessible systems, services, and resources on a target system. 

There are two ways of scanning: 

- Active Scanning
- Passive Scanning

Scanning allows you to identify open ports on the target system and can be used for port mapping, performing an interactive session with the operating system via those ports, or even redirecting traffic from these open ports. There are many tasks that can be performed with a scanning tool.

#### Active Scanning

Active scanning is a type of network scanning technique that is used to gather information about a target system or network. Unlike passive scanning, which only gathers information that is readily available, active scanning actively interacts with the target system to gather information.

It involves sending requests or packets to a target system and analyzing the responses to gather information about the target. This type of scanning is more aggressive and intrusive than passive scanning and is often used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a target system or network.

**Active Network Scanning Tools**  

- **Nmap** – Most popular tool for network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
- **Masscan** – Extremely fast port scanner, capable of scanning the entire internet.
- **Zmap** – Single-packet network scanner designed for high-speed scanning.
- **Angry IP Scanner** – Simple and fast scanner for detecting live hosts.
- **Unicornscan** – Advanced reconnaissance tool with asynchronous scanning.
- **Nikto** – Web server scanner that checks for vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploit** – Penetration testing framework with built-in scanning tools.
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability scanner used for security assessments.
- **Acunetix** – Web vulnerability scanner with automated scanning capabilities.
- **Scapy** – Python-based packet manipulation tool for scanning, sniffing, and forging packets.
- **hping3** – Advanced TCP/IP packet generator useful for scanning and penetration testing.
- **ping** – Simple ICMP echo request tool to check network connectivity.
- **tracert (Windows) / traceroute (Linux/macOS)** – Tracks the path packets take to a destination.


#### Passive Scanning

Passive scanning is a type of network scanning technique that is used to gather information about a target system or network without actively interacting with the target. Unlike active scanning, which sends requests or packets to the target and analyzes the responses, passive scanning only gathers information that is readily available, such as information transmitted over the network or stored in system logs.

It is used to gather information about a target system or network for a variety of purposes, including network mapping, vulnerability assessment, and compliance testing. By analyzing network traffic and system logs, passive scanning can provide valuable information about a target’s infrastructure, servers, and devices, as well as the types of services and applications that are running.

**Passive Network Scanning Tools**  

- **Wireshark** – Packet sniffer and network protocol analyzer.
- **tcpdump** – Command-line packet capture tool for network traffic analysis.
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)** – Network monitoring and security analysis tool.
- **Suricata** – Intrusion detection and prevention system with deep packet inspection.
- **Snort** – Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for real-time traffic analysis.
- **Arkime (formerly Moloch)** – Large-scale, full-packet capture system.

## Types of Network Attacks

Modern organizations rely on the internet for communication, and confidential data is often exchanged between networks. Remote accessibility also provides malicious parties with vulnerable targets for data interception. These may violate user privacy settings and compromise devices connected to the internet.

Network attacks occur in various forms. Enterprises need to ensure that they maintain the highest cybersecurity standards, network security policies, and staff training to safeguard their assets against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. 


### DOS

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack that makes a computer, website, or network resource unavailable to its intended users. This is achieved by overwhelming the target with traffic, causing it to crash or become unresponsive. DoS attacks can disrupt online services, websites, and other online resources, causing significant inconvenience and financial loss. 

### DDoS

DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks involve deploying sprawling networks of botnets — malware-compromised devices linked to the internet. These bombard and overwhelm enterprise servers with high volumes of fraudulent traffic. Malicious attackers may target time-sensitive data, such as that belonging to healthcare institutions, interrupting access to vital patient database records. 

### Man-in-the-middle Attacks

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) network attacks occur when malicious parties intercept traffic conveyed between networks and external data sources or within a network. In most cases, hackers achieve man-in-the-middle attacks via weak security protocols. These enable hackers to convey themselves as a relay or proxy account and manipulate data in real-time transactions. 


### Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can hold, causing data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities, as attackers can exploit buffer overflows to inject and execute malicious code.

### Unauthorized Access

Unauthorized access refers to network attacks where malicious parties gain access to enterprise assets without seeking permission. Such incidences may occur due to weak account password protection, unencrypted networks, insider threats that abuse role privileges, and the exploitation of inactive roles with administrator rights. 

Organizations should prioritize and maintain the least privilege principle to avoid the risks of privilege escalation and unauthorized access. 

### Packet sniffer

A passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer. By placing a passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter, that receiver can obtain a copy of every packet that is transmitted! These packets can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including passwords, social security numbers, trade secrets, and private personal messages. some of the best defenses against packet sniffing involve cryptography. 

### IP Spoofing 

The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing, and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user. To solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, a mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does.

### DNS spoofing

Also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver’s cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address. 

---

### ARP Table

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables store the MAC-to-IP address mappings of devices that have recently communicated on a network. By analyzing the ARP cache, you can passively identify devices in a network without actively probing them.

**Why ARP Table is Passive?**

It does not send any network packets (unlike active scanning tools like Nmap).
It relies on previously stored network interactions.
It helps in discovering devices without triggering IDS/IPS alerts.

**Windows:**

```
arp -a
```

- Displays the ARP table containing IP-to-MAC address mappings stored by the system.

**Linux:**

```
arp -n
```

- Displays the ARP table without resolving hostnames

```
ip neigh show
```

- Displays ARP table with additional information like connection state. Modern ARP table lookup with connection states.

## Firewalls

A Firewall is a Network Security System that Monitors and Controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on the predetermined security rules or more accurately **ACL** i.e **"Access Control List"**. It is like a safety barrier between the secured and trusted Private Network and the untrusted Public Network such as the internet where malicious virus and hackers relentlessly try to get access of our important and personal data.

## How Does Firewall Work?

![firewall-image](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ffirewall.png&w=3840&q=75)

Firewall resides at the junction or gateway between two networks (i.e Private and Public Network ). Generally, firewall work at **Layer 3** and **Layer 4** of OSI model (i.e Network and Transport Layer respectively ). It examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic and blocks those that do not meet the criteria of the specified security rules (i.e **ACL**). This rule can be based on a number of things such as:

1. **IP Address**
2. **Domain Names**
3. **Protocols**
4. **Programs**
5. **Ports**
6. **Key words**

etc...

| Rule | Action | Src Address | Dest Address | Protocol | Dest port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | allow | 173.17.0.0/16 | 11.2.0.0/16 | TCP | 80 |
| **2** | allow | 11.2.0.0/16 | 173.17.0.0/16 | TCP | \> 1023 |
| **3** | allow | 173.17.0.0/16 | 11.2.0.0/16 | UDP | 53 |
| **4** | allow | 11.2.0.0/16 | 173.17.0.0/16 | UDP | \> 1023 |
| **5** | deny | all | all | all | all |

Firewall has been the first line of defence in network security for over 25 years now. It filters the incoming traffic by the rules that is configured and customized by the Network Administrator. He decides what comes in and what goes out of the internal network. So it is a very important job. It is essential for homes and small businesses to have a strong configured firewall on their system. It is more important specially for the big organizations as there are a lot more servers and computers are attached with it and firewall keeps them safe by blocking or denying the malicious traffic.

## Types of Firewall:

Firewall either can be Hardware, Software or BOTH depending on their structure. Each type of firewall has different functionality but the same purpose.

### Hardware Firewall

![hardware-firewall](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fhardware-firewall.png&w=3840&q=75)

A hardware firewall is either a dedicated stand-alone hardware device or it comes as a part of a router. It is physical device that attaches between a computer network and a gateway. For example:- a broadband router. The network traffic is filtered using the packet filtering technique. It is used to filter out the network traffic for large business networks.

### Software Firewall

A Software firewall is a software program installed on a computer, just like normal software. It is generally used to filter for individual home users or small business. It only filter traffic for the computer on which it's installed, not for the network.

![software-firewall](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsoftware-firewall.png&w=3840&q=75)

Besides, there are many other types of firewalls depending on their features and the level of security they provide. The following are types of firewall techniques that can be implemented as software or hardware:

- Packet-filtering Firewalls
- Circuit-level Gateways
- Application-level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls)
- Stateful Multi-layer Inspection (SMLI) Firewalls
- Next-generation Firewalls (NGFW)
- Threat-focused NGFW
- Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls
- Cloud Firewalls
- Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewalls

#### Packet-filtering Firewalls

![packet-filtering-firewall](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fpacket-filtering-firewall.png&w=3840&q=75)

Packet filtering firewalls work at the Network layer of the OSI model. They are usually a part of the router. In a packet filtering firewall, each packet is compared to a set of criteria before it is forwarded. Depending on the packet and the criteria, the firewall can drop a packet or forward it, or send a message to the originator. We have already talked about the **ACL** in the "How does firewall work?" section of this article.

#### Circuit-level Gateways

Circuit-level Gateways work at the 5th layer or Session layer of the OSI model or more specifically TCP layer of the TCP/IP. Information passed to a remote computer through a circuit-level gateway appears to have originated from the gateway. They monitor requests to create sessions, and determine if the sessions will be allowed. Circuit proxy firewalls allow or prevent data streams; they do not filter individual packets.

#### Application-level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls)

Application-level Gateways (proxies) can filter packets at the 7th layer or Application Layer of the OSI model. Incoming and outgoing traffic is restricted to services by proxy; all other service requests are denied. Application-level Gateways configured as a web proxy prohibit FTP, gopher, telnet or other traffic. It examines traffic and filter on application-specific commands such as http:post and get.

#### Stateful Multi-layer Inspection (SMLI) Firewalls

Stateful Multi-layer Inspection Firewalls combine the aspect of the other three types of firewalls (i.e Packet Filtering, Circuit level Gateways and Application-level firewall). They filter packet at the network layer of the OSI model to determine whether session packets are legitimate, and they evaluate the contents of packets at the application layer. In most cases, SMLI firewalls are implemented as additional security levels. These types of firewalls implement more checks and are considered more secure than stateless firewalls. This is why stateful packet inspection is implemented along with many other firewalls to track statistics for all internal traffic.

#### Next-generation Firewalls (NGFW)

Firewalls have evolved beyond simple packet filtering and stateful inspection. Most companies are deploying next-generation firewalls to block modern threats such as advanced malware and application-layer attacks.

According to Gartner, Inc's definition, a next-generation firewall must include:

- Standard firewall capabilities like stateful inspection
- Integrated intrusion prevention
- Application awareness and control to see and block risky apps
- Upgrade paths to include future information feeds
- Techniques to address evolving security threats

While these capabilities are increasingly becoming the standard for most companies, NGFWs can do more.

#### Threat-focused NGFW

According to CISCO, these firewalls include all the capabilities of a traditional NGFW and also provide advanced threat detection and remediation. With a threat-focused one can:

- Know which assets are most at risk with complete context awareness.
- Quickly react to attacks with intelligent security automation that sets policies and hardness one's defenses dynamically.
- Better detect evasive or suspicious activity with network and endpoint event correlation.
- Greatly decrease the time from detection to cleanup with retrospective security that continuously monitors for suspicious activity and behavior even after initial inspection
- Ease administration and reduve complexity with unified policies that protect across the entire attack continuum.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls

Network Address Translation separates IP addresses into two sets and enables the LAN to use these addresses for internal and external traffic respectively. It also works with router, the same filtering does. NAT will also modify the packets the router sends at the same time. It has ability to change the address of the packet and make it appear to have from a valid address. It limits the number of public IP address and organization can use.

Network address translation or NAT firewalls are primarily designed to access internet traffic and block all unwanted connections. These types of firewalls usually hide the IP address of our devices, making it safe from attackers. When multiple devices are used to connect to the Internet, NAT firewalls create a unique IP address and hide individual devices' IP addresses. As a result a single IP address is used for all devices. By doing this NAT firewalls secure independent network addresses from attackers scanning a network for accessing IP addresses. This results in enhanced protection against suspicious activities and attacks.

#### Cloud Firewalls

As the name implies, a cloud firewall that is hosted in the cloud. The most significant advantage of cloud firewalls is scalability. Because cloud firewalls have no physical resources, they are easy to scale according to the organization's demand or traffic-load. If demand increases, additional capacity can be added to the cloud server to filter out the additional traffic load. It is also known as Faas or Firewall-as-a-Service.

Cloud firewalls block cyber attacks directed at the cloud platforms and infrastructure. Cloud based firewalls from a virtual barrier around cloud platforms, infrastructure, and applications, just as traditional firewalls form a barrier around an organizations intrenal network. Deploying a cloud firewall is like replacing a bank's local security cameras and physical security guard with a global 24/7 security center that has centralized staff and security camera feeds from all the placess where a bank's assets are stored.

#### Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewalls

A UTM device typically combines, in a loosely coupled way, the functions of a stateful inspection firewall with intrusion prevention and antivirus. It may also include additional services and often cloud management. UTMs focus on simplicity and ease of use.

Firewall Limitations:

1. A firewall does not prevent the network from new viruses, backdoor and insider attacks.
2. A firewall cannot do anything if the network design and configuration is faulty.
3. A Firewall is not an alternative to antivirus or anti-malware.
4. They can not prevent social engineering threats.
5. A firewall does not prevent password misuse.
6. A Firewall does not block attacks from a higher level of the protocol stack.
7. A firewall does not protect against attacks from dial-in connections and attacks originating from common ports or applications.
8. They are unable to understand tunneled traffic.

#### Conclusion

Although Firewall has some limitations but it is vital and essential part of the network Security irrespective of home, small or big organizations in question. It protects the important secret data from the outside threat. So, everyone should have a Firewall configured on their system.
