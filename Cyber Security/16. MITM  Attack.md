A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and manipulates communication between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker can eavesdrop, steal sensitive information, or alter the transmitted data.

---

## How a MITM Attack Works

1. **Interception**:

- The attacker positions themselves between two devices (e.g., a client and a server).

- They capture and possibly modify the traffic flowing between them.

2. **Decryption** (Optional):

- If encryption (e.g., HTTPS) is used, the attacker may attempt to break it using SSL stripping, fake certificates, or downgrade attacks.

3. **Data Manipulation**:

- The attacker can inject, alter, or drop packets in the communication stream.

4. **Exfiltration**:

- The stolen data (credentials, banking info, messages) is used for further exploitation.

## Types of MITM Attacks


 **1. ARP Spoofing (LAN-Based MITM)**

- Attacker **falsifies ARP messages**, making devices associate the attacker's MAC address with the legitimate gateway IP.
- Allows the attacker to intercept traffic within a **local network**.
- **Tool:** `arpspoof`, `Bettercap`, `Ettercap`, Wireshark.

**Use Wireshark for Detection:**

```wireshark
arp.duplicate-address-frame
```

---

**2. DNS Spoofing**

- Attacker **modifies DNS responses**, redirecting users to fake websites (e.g., phishing sites).
- Users think they are visiting a legitimate site but are actually communicating with the attacker.
- **Tool:** `dnsspoof`, `Bettercap`.

 **Use Wireshark for Detection:**

```wireshark
dns.flags.rcode != 0
```

---

 **3. SSL Stripping**

- The attacker forces a **secure HTTPS connection to downgrade to HTTP**.
- Victims unknowingly transmit sensitive data in plaintext.
- **Tool:** `Bettercap`, `SSLstrip`.

 **Use Wireshark for Detection:**

```wireshark
ssl.record.version < 0x0303
```

---

**4. Rogue Wi-Fi Access Point**

- The attacker **sets up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot** with a name similar to a legitimate one.
- Users connect, thinking it’s safe, but all their traffic is **monitored and manipulated**.
- **Tool:** `hostapd`, `Wireshark`, `Aircrack-ng`.

---

 **5. Email Hijacking**

- Attackers **intercept email communications**, allowing them to read, modify, or impersonate users.
- **Common Exploits:**
    - **Man-in-the-Browser (MITB):** Injects malware into browsers to manipulate webmail.
    - **SMTP Spoofing:** Exploits SMTP protocol weaknesses to forge emails.
- **Tools:** Wireshark, `dsniff`.

**Detection (Wireshark Filter):**

```wireshark
smtp
```

---

**6. Session Hijacking**

- The attacker **steals a user's session token** (e.g., cookies, JWTs) to gain unauthorized access to an account.
- **Common Exploits:**
    - **Sidejacking:** Capturing session cookies from unencrypted traffic.
    - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Injects JavaScript to steal tokens.
- **Tools:** `Hamster & Ferret`, `Bettercap`.

**Detection (Wireshark Filter):**

```wireshark
http.cookie
```

---

**7. IP Spoofing**

- The attacker **forges the source IP address** to appear as a trusted device.
- Used to **bypass authentication, launch DoS attacks, or impersonate users**.
- **Tools:** `hping3`, `Scapy`.

 **Detection (Wireshark Filter):**

```wireshark
ip.src != expected_ip
```

---

**8. Stealing Browser Cookies**

- Attackers intercept **HTTP cookies** to hijack user sessions.
- **Common Methods:**
    - **Packet sniffing on HTTP traffic (no SSL/TLS).**
    - **XSS-based cookie theft.**
- **Tools:** `Wireshark`, `Bettercap`.

 **Detection (Wireshark Filter):**

```wireshark
http contains "Set-Cookie"
```

---

## How to Perform a MITM Attack (Ethical Testing)

 **ARP Spoofing with Bettercap**

```bash
sudo bettercap -iface eth0
```


```bash
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.1.10
arp.spoof on
```

- Redirects **192.168.1.10's traffic** through the attacker’s machine.

### How to Detect a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack

Detecting a **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack** requires a combination of **technical monitoring and user awareness**, as cybercriminals use sophisticated methods that can be hard to spot. While MitM attacks share elements with **phishing and spoofing**, making them seem recognizable, modern attackers employ advanced techniques that demand a more vigilant approach. **Prevention is crucial**, but certain warning signs can indicate that an attack is in progress.

**1. Unusual Disconnections**

A key red flag of a MitM attack is **unexpected or repeated service disconnections**. If a user is frequently logged out of an online service and has to **re-enter their username and password multiple times**, it could indicate an attacker **intercepting login attempts**. Cybercriminals rely on these repeated login prompts to capture credentials, making this an essential behavior to watch for.

 **2. Strange URLs & Spoofed Websites**

MitM attackers often use **DNS hijacking** to redirect users to **fake websites** that appear identical to trusted ones. These spoofed sites trick victims into entering their credentials, which are then intercepted by the attacker. A telltale sign is a **suspicious URL** in the browser’s address bar that **does not match the legitimate website's address**. Users should always verify web addresses, especially for **banking or financial transactions**, as a compromised URL could indicate a MitM attempt.

**3. Public, Unsecured Wi-Fi Risks**

Public Wi-Fi, especially from **unknown or untrusted sources**, is a common vector for MitM attacks. Unlike secure municipal Wi-Fi, malicious networks—often given innocent-sounding names like **"Local Free Wireless"**—allow attackers to monitor and manipulate user traffic. Even if users avoid sensitive transactions, attackers can **inject malicious code** into their device, allowing them to **eavesdrop on messages and chats**.

**Detection with Wireshark**

|**Threat**|**Wireshark Filter**|
|---|---|
|ARP Spoofing|`arp.duplicate-address-frame`|
|DNS Spoofing|`dns.flags.rcode != 0`|
|SSL Downgrade|`ssl.record.version < 0x0303`|
|Suspicious Redirects|`http contains "302 Found"`|

### How to Prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

Implementing **strong cybersecurity practices** is essential for protecting individuals and organizations from **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks**. Since these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in **network security, encryption, and authentication**, taking **proactive measures** can significantly reduce the risk.

 **1. Secure and Update Home Wi-Fi Routers**

For remote workers, securing home **Wi-Fi routers** is crucial. Since many organizations have **work-from-home (WFH) policies**, employees should:

- Regularly **update their router firmware manually** (since updates are not automatic).
- Use the **strongest encryption standard available (WPA3)** to prevent unauthorized access.
- Disable **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**, which attackers can exploit to gain access to networks.

**2. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)**

A **VPN encrypts all internet traffic**, making it difficult for attackers to intercept or modify data. Employees and users should:

- Always **connect via a trusted VPN** when using public or unsecured networks.
- Ensure the VPN uses **strong encryption protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard**.

**3. Enable End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for Communication**

To protect sensitive communications, employees should use **end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging apps** such as **WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram**. Some key points include:

- Ensuring **E2EE is enabled** in email and chat applications.
- **Verifying encryption manually** when necessary (e.g., comparing QR codes in WhatsApp).


**4. Keep Software Updated & Use Antivirus Protection**

**Regular updates** prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers, and software. Employees should:

- **Install security patches immediately** when available.
- Keep **antivirus and anti-malware software** up to date.
- Use **endpoint protection tools** to detect and mitigate attacks.


**5. Use Strong Passwords & a Password Manager**

Weak or reused passwords increase the risk of credential theft. To mitigate this:

- **Use complex passwords** with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Utilize a **password manager** to store and generate secure passwords.
- Implement **mobile device management (MDM)** software to enforce password policies on company-owned devices.


**6. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication (e.g., SMS code, app-based OTP, or biometrics). Organizations should:

- Require **MFA for all user logins** to company networks and sensitive systems.
- Use **hardware-based authentication (e.g., YubiKey, FIDO2 keys)** for maximum security.


**7. Connect Only to Secure HTTPS Websites**

MitM attackers often exploit unsecured HTTP connections. Users should:

- **Only visit HTTPS websites** (check for the **padlock icon** in the browser).
- Install **browser plugins that force HTTPS** (e.g., **HTTPS Everywhere**).
- Organizations should deploy **web filtering solutions** to **block access to unsecured sites**.


**8. Encrypt DNS Traffic (Prevent DNS Spoofing)**

Attackers can manipulate DNS queries to redirect users to malicious websites. To prevent this:

- Use **DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT)** to encrypt DNS queries.
- Configure browsers and operating systems to use **secure, trusted DNS resolvers**.


**9. Adopt a Zero-Trust Security Model**

The **Zero-Trust** approach ensures that no device, user, or system is automatically trusted. Organizations should:

- Implement **continuous authentication** instead of relying solely on initial login credentials.
- Require **identity verification** before granting access to sensitive systems.
- Apply **strict access control policies** for internal and external users.

 **10. Deploy User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**

Modern **cyberattacks are evolving**, making traditional security measures insufficient. **User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)** solutions can:

- **Use AI and machine learning** to detect unusual user behavior.
- Identify **small anomalies** that may indicate a **MitM attack**.
- Automate threat response to **mitigate attacks in real-time**.
