 ****What is a Network?**

A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, switches, routers) that can share resources and information. Networking enables communication, data transfer, and access to remote resources.

## Types of Networks:

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or campus.

* **Characteristics:**

	* High bandwidth (fast data transfer speeds)
    * Low latency (minimal delays in data transmission)
    * Often privately owned and managed

* **Examples:**

    * A network connecting computers within a single office 
    * A network connecting devices in a home 


---

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans large geographical areas, often used by corporations or ISPs. Internet is the largest WAN.

* **Characteristics:**

    * Typically relies on leased telecommunication lines (e.g., dedicated lines, leased lines) or public networks (e.g., the internet)
    * Can have varying bandwidth and latency depending on the underlying infrastructure

* **Examples:**

    * A company's internal network connecting its headquarters with branch offices in different cities
    * The internet itself, which is a global WAN

---

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or town. Larger than a LAN, smaller than a WAN.

* **Characteristics:**

    * Can offer higher bandwidth than traditional WAN connections but may have higher costs
    * Often used to interconnect government offices, universities, or businesses within a city

* **Examples:**

    * A network connecting government buildings within a city
    * A university network connecting its various campuses and departments

---

- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Small network typically used for devices like phones, tablets, and laptops.

### Network Architectures

A **host** in networking refers to any device connected to a network, assigned a network address, and capable of functioning as a **client**, **server**, or **peer**:

- **Client:** Requests data or services.
- **Server:** Provides data or services.
- **Peer:** Can both request and provide data.


**Types of Network Architectures**

![][https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0106/6339/5391/files/Peer-to-peer_and_client-server_architecture_1024x1024.jpg?v=1727573346]

#### 1. Peer-to-Peer Architecture

 **All hosts can both request and provide data/services.

**Advantages:**

- Simple to configure.

**Disadvantages:**

- Data management and backups are challenging due to decentralized data storage.

 - Security requires individual user account setup on each device.

#### 2. Client/Server Architecture**

In the client-server architecture, the central server handles data storage, client request processing, network security and access control, while other client devices access resources and communicate with each other through the server.

 **Advantages:**

-  Centralized data and service management.
  
- Improved scalability and security.

**Disadvantages:**

- The server can be a single point of failure unless redundancy is implemented.

## Network Components and Devices

Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network.


### Core Devices:

1. **Router**

A router connects different networks, such as a home or business network to the internet. It routes data between these networks, allowing devices within a local network to communicate with each other and with external networks.

**Example:** A Wi-Fi router in a home network, directing traffic between devices like smartphones, computers, and the internet.

**Diagram:**

![][https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wan-wlan-technology-connection-computers_1232-4122.jpg?t=st=1736578818~exp=1736582418~hmac=d8c7a15b7f5192fb0316e568812f2e30370b22537f5ca11de1a539686e6fa488&w=740]

---

2. **Switch**

A switch is used to connect multiple devices within a single network. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and forwards data to devices based on MAC addresses. It improves network efficiency by directing data only to the destination device, rather than broadcasting it to all devices.

**Example:** A network switch in an office connecting computers, printers, and servers within a local network.

**Diagram:**

![][https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/network-switch-with-cables_1137-6.jpg?t=st=1736579018~exp=1736582618~hmac=221a001c39e697bf11cfe3612577b1efaad050358752aa3702172ae8f5c6575b&w=740]

---

**3. Hub**

A hub is a simple networking device that connects multiple devices within a network. Unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts data to all devices, which can cause network inefficiency, especially in large networks.

**Example:** An older or small office network where a hub connects various devices.

**Diagram:**

![][https://5.imimg.com/data5/VS/JR/AU/SELLER-11828670/d-link-network-hub-1000x1000.jpg]

---

**4. Access Point (AP)**

An access point allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It is often used in larger networks or homes where devices like smartphones and laptops need wireless connectivity.

**Example:** A Wi-Fi access point in a home providing internet connectivity to smartphones, laptops, and tablets.

**Diagram:**

![][https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/isometric-mobile-network-concept_1284-18852.jpg?t=st=1736579249~exp=1736582849~hmac=52c1e87e96c6e15a874d316f2a96eee64ce0f366f18e4e775ce3150ed5ad78e9&w=740]

---

**5. Modem**

A modem (modulator-demodulator) connects a local network to the internet by converting the digital data from a computer into a signal that can be transmitted over phone lines, cable systems, or fiber optics.

**Example:** A cable modem used by internet service providers (ISPs) to provide internet access to homes or businesses.

**Diagram:**

![][https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230826113414/Modembak.png]

---

**6. Bridge**

A bridge connects two separate networks to work as a single network. It operates at the data link layer and helps segment traffic in large networks to reduce congestion.

**Example:** A bridge connecting two Wi-Fi networks in a large building.

**Diagram:**

![][https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241112120628072153/Hub-vs-Switches.webp]

---

**7. Gateway**

A gateway acts as a translator between two different network protocols, allowing communication between different types of networks. It often includes routing and firewall functions.

**Example:** A gateway connecting an office's internal network to the public internet, especially in scenarios involving VPNs or private network communication.

**Diagram:**

![][https://datasave.qsfptek.com/upload/2024-03-11/1710148821173.png]


These devices are crucial for maintaining efficient, secure, and scalable network operations, each playing a unique role in enabling communication across various network infrastructures.

### Other Components:

- **NIC (Network Interface Card):** Hardware allowing devices to connect to a network.

- **Cables:**

    - **Twisted Pair (Cat5e, Cat6)** – Used in Ethernet networks.
    
    - **Coaxial Cable** – Used in cable internet.
    
    - **Fiber Optic Cable** – For high-speed long-distance communication.

## 3. Network Topologies

**Network Topology**, you may wonder what this means. Basically a network topology means a kind of arrangement of the elements of a communication network. In other words, network topology refers to the geometric shape that a network takes when it is laid physically. When it comes to networks there are many ways a network can be arranged.

There are five types of network topology in computer networks:

1. **Bus Topology**
2. **Ring Topology**
3. **Mesh Topology**
4. **Star Topology**
5. **Tree Topology**
6. **Hybrid Topology**

##### 1) Bus Topology

Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly two endpoints, then it is called **Linear Bus topology**.

![bus-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fbus-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Features of Bus Topology**

- It transmits data only in one direction.
- Every device is connected to a single cable

**Advantages of Bus Topology**

- It is cost effective
- Cable required is least compared to other network topology.
- Used in small networks.
- It is easy to understand.
- Easy to expand joining two cables together.

**Disadvantages of Bus Topology**

- Cable fails then whole network fails
- If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network decreases.
- Cable has a limited length.
- It is slower than the ring topology.

---

##### 2) Ring Topology

It is called ring topology because it forms a ring as each computer is connected to another computer, with the last one connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device.

![ring-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fring-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)


**Features of Ring Topology**

- A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with large number of nodes because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
  
- The transmission is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called **Dual Ring Topology**.

- In Dual Ring Topology, two ring networks are formed, and data flow is in opposite direction in them. Also, if one fails the second rin can act as a backup, to keep the network up.
  
- Data is transferred in a sequential manner that is bit by bit. Data transmitted, has to pass through each node of the network, till the destination node.


**Advantages of Ring Topology**

- Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by adding more nodes, as only the nodes having tokens can transmit data.

- Cheap to install and expand.


**Disadvantages of Ring Topology**

- Troubleshooting is difficult in ring topology.
- Adding or deleting the computers disturbs the network activity.
- Failure of one computer disturbs the whole network.

---

##### 3) Star Topology

In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.

![star-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fstar-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)


**Features of Star Topology**

- Every node has its own dedicated connection to the hub.
- Hub acts as a repeater for data flow.
- Can be used with twisted pair, Optical Fibre or coaxial cable.

**Advantages of Star Topology**

- Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic.
- Hub can be upgraded easily.
- Easy to troubleshoot.
- Easy to setup and modify.
- Only that node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes can work smoothly.

**Disadvantages of Star Topology**

- Cost of installation is high
- Expensive to use.
- If the hub fails then the whole network is stopped because all the nodes depend on the hub.
- Performance is based on the hub that is it depends on its capacity

---

##### 4) Mesh Topology


It is a point-to-point connection to other nodes or devices. All the network nodes are connected to each other. Mesh has `n(n-1)/2` physical channels to link `n` devices.

**Types of Mesh Topology**

1. **Partial Mesh Topology**: In this topology some of the systems are connected in the same fashion as mesh topology but some devices are only connected to two or three devices.
2. **Full Mesh Topology**: Each and every nodes or devices are connected to each other.

![mesh-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fmesh-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)


**Features of Mesh Topology**

- Fully connected
- Robust.
- Not flexible.

**Advantages of Mesh Topology**

- Each connection can carry its own data load.
- It is robust.
- Fault is diagnosed easily.
- Provides security and privacy.

**Disadvantages of Mesh Topology**

- Installation and configuration is difficult.
- Cabling cost is more.
- Bulk wiring is required.

---

##### 5) Tree Topology

It has a root node and all other nodes are connected to it forming a hierarchy. It is also called hierarchical topology. It should at least have three levels to the hierarchy.

![tree-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Ftree-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)


**Features of Tree Topology**

- Ideal if workstations are located in groups.
- Used in Wide Area Network

**Advantages of Tree Topology**

- Extension of bus and star topologies.
- Expansion of nodes is possible and easy.
- Easily manages and maintained.
- Error detection is easily done.

**Disadvantages of Tree Topology**

- Heavily cabled.
- Costly.
- If more nodes are added maintenance is difficult.
- Central hub fails, network fails.

---

##### 6) Hybrid Topology

It is two different types of topologies which is a mixture of two or more topologies. For example if in an office in one department ring topology is used and in another star topology is used, connecting these topologies will result in Hybrid Topology (ring topology and star topology).

![hybrid-topology](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fhybrid-topology.png&w=3840&q=75)


**Features of Hybrid Topology**

- It is a combination of two or topologies
- Inherits the advantages and disadvantages of the topologies included

**Advantages of Hybrid Topology**

- Reliable as Error detecting and trouble shooting is easy.
- Effective.
- Scalable as size can be increased easily.
- Flexible.

**Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology**

- Complex in design.
- Costly.

## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI Model)


The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

OSI Model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. 

The OSI Model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities


**Purpose of the OSI Model**

- Provides a universal language for networking.
- Standardizes networking functions to enable interoperability between different systems and technologies.
- Breaks down complex network interactions into manageable and understandable layers.
- Facilitates troubleshooting by isolating issues to a specific layer.

#### OSI Model (7 Layers):

![osi-model-diagram][https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719848845717.svg]

---

#### 1. Physical

The first OSI model layer describes the physical connections between devices in a network. Electrical, optic, or electromagnetic signal data moves from device to device through the physical infrastructure defined by this layer.

**Elements of the OSI layer model’s physical layer include:**

- Electrical, mechanical, and physical systems, parts, and devices
- Specifications such as cable size, signal frequency, voltages, etc.
- How a network is configured, such as a bus, with devices arranged in a line with many stops, a star, with a central device surrounded by an array of devices, a ring with devices in a connected circle, a mesh of woven interconnections, and more
- Communication modes such as one-way simplex, two-way full duplex, or half duplex, with messages going back and forth, but only one direction at a time
- Data transmission performance, such as bit rate, referring to how much data is moving through a connection at a given time, and bit synchronization to align the clocks of each device for accurate data transmission
- Modulation, switching, and interfacing with the physical transmission medium
- Common protocols for connections, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and others
- Hardware, including networking devices, antennas, cables, modems, and intermediate devices such as repeaters and hubs

#### 2. The Data Link Layer

The second OSI model layer describes data transmission between network devices. Data is sent in packets within a frame of special bit patterns or codes that indicate the beginning and end of each packet. These packets move through switches that route information through the physical layer from one physical location to another.

**The OSI data link layer has two sublayers:**

- The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer manages flow and error controls to ensure accurate data transmission between the network devices.
- The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer manages access and permissions for transmitting data between devices. The function of this sublayer is to manage which device controls a channel, moment to moment.

#### 3. The Network Layer

The third of the OSI layers organizes and transmits data between multiple networks. Network layer hardware includes routes, bridge routers, 3-layer switches, and protocols such as Internet (IPv4) Protocol version 4 and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

This layer routes data via the shortest or fastest physical path, working around traffic controls, congestion, broken links, service priority, and more. It handles addressing logic to distinguish between the source and destination networks. It divides data into packets to send and then reassembles them at their destination.

#### 4. The Transport Layer

This layer deals with sending and delivering of complete and reliable data from one device to another through a network or between networks. Common transport layer protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for connection-oriented data transmission and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for connectionless data transmission.

Some of the essential functions in this layer include:

- Error control, flow control, and congestion control are ways to keep track of data packets, check for errors and duplication, and then to resend if there is an error or failure.
- Service-point addressing ensures that data is delivered to the correct protocol, identified by a port number.
- Packet segmentation and reassembly are processes for dividing data and sending it sequentially, then rechecking it at its destination for integrity and accuracy.

#### 5. The Session Layer

This OSI Model layer concerns itself with managing session links between network devices with a specific beginning and end. The essential functions include establishing a link to start the session, authenticating senders and receivers, authorizing communications between devices and apps, maintaining the session, and terminating the connection, which are the key functions.

A common session type is when an internet user visits and browses a website for a specific period.

An essential concept in this layer is synchronization, in which checkpoints during the session ensure a coordinated data flow that is free of unplanned breaks or data loss.

**Common OSI session layer protocols include:**

- Remote procedure call protocol (RPC)
- Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
- Session Control Protocol (SCP)
- Session Description Protocol (SDP)

#### 6. The Presentation Layer

Data flows as packets of code, often encrypted, through networks. Presenting it in a useful format is the focus of the sixth OSI model layer. The presentation layer deals with:

- Data conversion
- Character code translation
- Data compression
- Encryption and decryption

To send text across a network, the characters of the alphabet convert via a character coding system, such as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) that is then encrypted and compressed and sent over the network. On the receiving end, the process reverses. Different kinds of data get translated into different format codes.

#### 7. The Application Layer

The top layer of the OSI 7 layer model is the application layer. It is how a user application, such as a website, browser, email, instant messaging, file transfers, or voice-over IP, interfaces with the network. Think of it as the window for accessing the network to send or display data, which can be anything from a picture of your pet cat to a database of statistics to a voice message.

It facilitates networking requests, determines resource availability, synchronizes communication, and manages application-specific networking requirements. The application layer also identifies constraints at the application level, such as those associated with authentication, privacy, quality of service, networking devices, and data syntax.

**Common OSI application layer protocols include:**

![][https://s7280.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/osi-model-7-layers-1.png]

### TCP/IP Model (4 Layers):

The TCP/IP model is a fundamental framework for computer networking. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet. 

This model defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices.

Defines how data is transmitted over networks. And ensures reliable communication between devices over networks.

- Consists of four layers:
    - **Link Layer**
    - **Internet Layer**
    - **Transport Layer**
    - **Application Layer**

Designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s.

Developed alongside the creation of the ARPANET, which later became the foundation of the modern internet. 

![][https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/tcp_ip_protocol.jpg]

---

#### Layers of TCP/IP Model

##### 1. Application Layer

In TCP/IP, the Application layer protocols provide services to the application software running on a computer. The application layer uses HTTP, POP3, and SMTP protocols. The application layer provides an interface between the software running on a computer and the network itself.

##### 2. Transport Layer

In TCP/IP, the Transport layer includes transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP provides services to the application layer that reside above the transport layer or higher within the TCP/IP model.

##### 3. Internet Layer (Network Layer)

The Internet layer in the TCP/IP model is the Network Layer 3 of the OSI model. It stores the IP addresses and the routing data. When data is transmitted from a node on one LAN to a node on a different LAN, the Internet Layer is used. IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, and routing protocols (among others) are the Internet Layer TCP/IP protocols.

##### 4. Host-to-Network or Link Layer

In TCP/IP, the Host-to-Network layer is also called the network interface or _link layer_. It provides services to the upper layer within the model. When a hosts or routers IP process chooses to send an IP packet to a different router or host, that host or router then uses the link-layer details to send that packet to the next host/router.

This layer is the lowermost layer of the TCP/IP model; it is concerned with the physical transmission of data. It is like a combination of the data link layer and physical layer of the OSI model.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

**What is an IP**

An IP address stands for **"Internet Protocol Address"**, which is a set of rules for communication over the internet, such as sending mail, streaming video, or connecting to website. **An IP address identifies a network or device on the internet**.

Internet Protocol Address mainly refers to a numbering scheme, providing a highly unique number to every machine connected to the internet. (Internet protocols do other things as well, such as routing internet traffic). This way, it's easy to see which devices on the internet are sending, requesting and receiving what information.

#### Versions of IP Address

#### IPv4

IPv4 stands for internet protocol version 4. This is the one you will see used the most. These addresses are **32-bit long** and divided into **four parts** known as **octets**, each octet containing **8 bit**. This protocol has been around **since 1981** and has not seen many changes since. Despite it having **4,294,967,296** possible IP addresses, we are still running out of them to use.

![ipv4-address](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fipv4-address.png&w=3840&q=75)

---

#### IPv6

IPv6 is the newest version of internet protocol formulated by the IETF, which helps identify and local endpoint systems on a computer network and route online traffic while addressing the problem of IPv4 address depletion due to prolonged internet use worldwide.

It uses a **128-bit** addressing system, allowing for approximately 3.4x10<sup>38</sup> addresses. The actual number is a bit lower as some IPs are reserved for special use.

IPv6 address is expressed by **eight groups of hexadecimal (base16)** numbers separated by colons. Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon separator to mark the gap.

![ipv6-address](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fnetworking%2Fipv6-address.png&w=3840&q=75)

---

Here are some of the main advantages IPv6 provides:

-   Faster routing
-   Better end-to-end connectivity
-   Easier administration
-   Improved mobility features
-   Superior Multicast and Anycast abilities
-   More security for applications and networks

#### IP Address Classes

|Class|Range|Default Subnet Mask|
|---|---|---|
|A|1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255|255.0.0.0|
|B|128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255|255.255.0.0|
|C|192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255|255.255.255.0|

**Class A** addresses are for networks with large number of total hosts. Class A allows for 126 networks by using the first octet for the network ID. 

**Class B** addresses are for medium to large sized networks. Class B allows for 16,384 networks by using the first two octets for the network ID. 

**Class C** addresses are used in small local area networks (LANs). Class C allows for approximately 2 million networks by using the first three octets for the network ID. 

**Class D** IP addresses are not allocated to hosts and are used for multicasting. 

**Multicasting** allows a single host to send a single stream of data to thousands of hosts across the Internet at the same time. It is often used for audio and video streaming, such as IP-based cable TV networks. 

![ipv4-classes-examples](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8e5e0-ipv4-classes-examples-15.webp?w=1201)

#### Types of IP addresses

**Private IP addresses**

Every device that connects to your internet network has a private IP address. This includes computers, smartphones, and tablets but also any Bluetooth internet of things, the number of private IP addresses you have at home is probably growing. Your router needs a way to identify these items separately, and many items need a way to recognize each other. Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that differentiate them on the network.

**Public IP addresses**

A public IP address is the primary address associated with your whole network. While each connected device has it own IP address, they are also included within the main IP address for your network. As described above, your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers. Your public IP address that all the devices outside your internet network will use to recognize your network.


**Special IP Addresses**

 IP Range: 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are network testing addresses (also referred to as loop-back addresses). These are virtual IP address, in that they cannot be assigned to a device. 

Specifically, the IP 127.0.0.1 is often used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues using the `ping command`. Specifically, it tests a computer's TCP/IP network software driver to ensure it is working properly.

A **local broadcast address** (255.255.255.255) sends messages to all devices on the **same local network** and is not routed.

Not routed  means that the broadcast message is confined to a **single network or subnet** and **does not pass through routers** to other networks.

A **directed broadcast address** (e.g., 192.168.1.255) targets all devices on a **specific subnet** and can be routed.

Routers can forward directed broadcasts to other networks as long as the broadcast is targeting a specific subnet.

The **loopback address** (127.0.0.1) is used to test the network stack of the **local machine** without leaving the device.

A **network mask** (netmask) is a 32-bit number that is used to identify the network portion of an IP address. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to determine which hosts are in the same network and which hosts are in different networks.

![classes-ipv4-binary](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/203e2-classes-ipv4-binary-17.webp?w=1201)


The **broadcast address** of the network is the last address of the network. Like the network address, the broadcast address cannot be assigned to a host.

#### How IP address assigned: Dynamic vs. Static

IP addresses can be permanent (static) or temporary (dynamic).

**Dynamic IP addresses**

Dynamic IP addresses change automatically and regularly. ISPs buy a large pool of IP addresses and assign them automatically to their customers. Periodically, they re-assign them and put the older IP addresses back into the pool to be used for other customers. 

**Static IP addresses**

In contrast to dynamic IP addresses, static addresses remain consistent. Once the network assigns an IP address, it remains the same. Most individuals and businesses do not need a static IP address, but for businesses that plan to host their own server, it is crucial to have one. This is because a static IP address ensures that websites and email addresses tied to it will have a consistent IP address -- vital if you want other devices to be able to find them consistently on the web.

---
### Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable networks called subnets. This is done by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address and using them to create new network addresses.

**Why Subnet**

- **Efficiency:** Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, especially in large networks.
- **Security:** By dividing a network into smaller segments, you can improve security by controlling traffic flow and isolating potential threats.
- **Broadcast Reduction:** Subnetting reduces the number of unnecessary broadcasts, improving network performance.
- **Administrative Ease:** Subnetting makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot network problems.

**Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)** is a method for assigning IP addresses more flexibly and efficiently, replacing the older classful system (Class A, B, C). 

It allows for variable-length subnet masks, meaning that IP addresses can be allocated in smaller or larger blocks, as needed, rather than being restricted to fixed-size classes. 

This results in better utilization of the IP address space and improved routing table management.

---
## Protocols

Network protocols are sets of rules that govern communication between networked devices, ensuring they can understand each other regardless of their hardware or software.

Network protocols enable the exchange of information across the internet. They work behind the scenes so effectively that most users don't know what they do and don't think twice about how they work.

Networking protocols are categorized into three main types: communication protocols that facilitate **data exchange** between devices, **management protocols** that oversee and control network operations, and **security protocols** that ensure the protection, authentication and integrity of data during transmission.

### UDP and TCP

The IP protocol allows us to reach a destination host on the network; the host is identified by its IP address. We need protocols that would enable processes on networked hosts to communicate with each other. There are two transport protocols to achieve that: UDP and TCP.

#### UDP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) allows us to reach a specific process on this target host. UDP is a simple connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer, i.e., layer 4. Being connectionless means that it does not need to establish a connection. UDP does not even provide a mechanism to know that the packet has been delivered.

An IP address identifies the host; we need a mechanism to determine the sending and receiving process. This can be achieved by using port numbers. A port number uses two octets; consequently, it ranges between 1 and 65535; port 0 is reserved. (The number 65535 is calculated by the expression 216 − 1.)

A real-life example similar to UDP is the standard mail service, with no delivery confirmation. In other words, there is no guarantee that the UDP packet has been received successfully, similar to the case of sending a parcel using standard mail with no confirmation of delivery. In the case of standard mail, it means a cheaper cost than the mail delivery options with confirmation. In the case of UDP, it means better speed than a transport protocol that provides “confirmation.”

But what if we want a transport protocol that acknowledges received packets? The answer lies in using TCP instead of UDP.

#### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses various mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery sent by the different processes on the networked hosts. Like UDP, it is a layer 4 protocol. Being connection-oriented, it requires the establishment of a TCP connection before any data can be sent.

In TCP, each data octet has a sequence number; this makes it easy for the receiver to identify lost or duplicated packets. The receiver, on the other hand, acknowledges the reception of data with an acknowledgement number specifying the last received octet.

A TCP connection is established using what’s called a three-way handshake. Two flags are used: SYN (Synchronise) and ACK (Acknowledgment). The packets are sent as follows:

1. SYN Packet: The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains the client’s randomly chosen initial sequence number.
2. SYN-ACK Packet: The server responds to the SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet, which adds the initial sequence number randomly chosen by the server.
3. ACK Packet: The three-way handshake is completed as the client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the reception of the SYN-ACK packet.

![The TCP three-way handshake requires the exchange of three packets.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719849036216.svg)  

Similar to UDP, TCP identifies the process of initiating or waiting (listening) for a connection using port numbers. As stated, a valid port number ranges between 1 and 65535 because it uses two octets and port 0 is reserved.

#### Internet and Communication Protocols

**1. IP (Internet Protocol)**  

Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Every device on a network has an IP address, which helps in identifying it uniquely.

**2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of a stream of data between applications. It checks for errors and guarantees that data is delivered without duplication and in the correct order.

**3. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  

UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows sending messages without establishing a reliable connection. It is faster than TCP but does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or error-checking. It is used in real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming.

**4. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**  

ICMP is used by network devices to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address. It is commonly used in network diagnostics tools like ping and traceroute.

**5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**  

ARP is used to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses in a local area network. When a device wants to communicate with another on the same network, it uses ARP to find the MAC address associated with the IP address.



#### Web and File Transfer Protocols


**6. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**  

HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting hypertext such as web pages over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

**7. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**  

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that uses encryption protocols like SSL or TLS to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's computer and the site.

**8. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**  

FTP is used to transfer files between a client and a server on a computer network. It requires a login with a username and password and is useful for uploading or downloading files from websites.

**9. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**  

SFTP is a secure version of FTP that runs over the SSH protocol. It provides encryption for file transfers, making it suitable for transferring sensitive data.

**10. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**  

TFTP is a simplified version of FTP with no authentication or encryption. It is typically used to transfer configuration files and firmware to network devices.



#### Email Protocols


**11. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**  

SMTP is used to send emails from an email client to an email server or between servers. It is a push protocol and works well for sending emails but not retrieving them.

**12. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**  

POP3 is used to retrieve emails from a mail server. Once the emails are downloaded, they are typically deleted from the server. This makes it suitable for users who access email from a single device.

**13. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**  

IMAP allows access to email messages from multiple devices by storing them on the server. Users can organize, delete, and manage messages directly on the mail server.

#### Network Services Protocols

**14. DNS (Domain Name System)**  

DNS translates human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into machine-readable IP addresses. This system is crucial for the functioning of the internet.

**15. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**  

DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate effectively.

**16. NTP (Network Time Protocol)**  

NTP synchronizes the clocks of computers to a reference time source, ensuring consistent timekeeping across networked systems.


#### Remote Access and Management Protocols

**17. SSH (Secure Shell)**  

SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, allowing secure remote login and other secure network services.

**18. Telnet**  

Telnet is a protocol used to provide bidirectional interactive text-based communication via a virtual terminal connection. However, it lacks encryption and is considered insecure.

**19. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**  

RDP allows users to connect to another computer over a network and control it remotely with a graphical interface. It is primarily used in Windows environments.



#### Routing Protocols

**20. RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**  

RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol used in local and wide area networks. It uses hop count as a routing metric and is one of the oldest routing protocols.

**21. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**  

OSPF is a link-state routing protocol used in larger enterprise networks. It calculates the shortest path for data using Dijkstra's algorithm.

**22. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**  

BGP is used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the internet. It is the protocol that makes core routing decisions on the internet.



#### Directory and Network Management

**23. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**  

LDAP is used to access and manage directory information services over a network. It is commonly used for storing user credentials and permissions in enterprise environments.

**24. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**  

SNMP is used to collect and organize information about managed devices on IP networks and to modify that information to change device behavior.

**25. MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**  

MPLS is a data-carrying technique that speeds up and shapes traffic flows across enterprise and service provider networks. It routes data using labels rather than long network addresses.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an essential concept as it allows each layer to focus on its intended function. In the image below, we have the following four steps:

- **Application data**: It all starts when the user inputs the data they want to send into the application. For example, you write an email or an instant message and hit the send button. The application formats this data and starts sending it according to the application protocol used, using the layer below it, the transport layer.
  
- **Transport protocol segment or datagram**: The transport layer, such as TCP or UDP, adds the proper header information and creates the TCP **segment** (or UDP **datagram**). This segment is sent to the layer below it, the network layer.
  
- **Network packet**: The network layer, i.e. the Internet layer, adds an IP header to the received TCP segment or UDP datagram. Then, this IP **packet** is sent to the layer below it, the data link layer.
  
- **Data link frame**: The Ethernet or WiFi receives the IP packet and adds the proper header and trailer, creating a **frame**.

We start with application data. At the transport layer, we add a TCP or UDP header to create a **TCP segment** or **UDP datagram**. Again, at the network layer, we add the proper IP header to get an **IP packet** that can be routed over the Internet. Finally, we add the appropriate header and trailer to get a WiFi or Ethernet frame at the link layer.

![Application data is encapsulated within a TCP segment or UDP datagram, which in turn is encapsulated within an IP packet. The IP packet is encapsulated within a data link frame.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719849061418.svg)  

The process has to be reversed on the receiving end until the application data is extracted.

#### The Life of a Packet

Based on what we have studied so far, we can explain a _simplified version_ of the packet’s life. Let’s consider the scenario where you search for a room on TryHackMe.

1. On the TryHackMe search page, you enter your search query and hit enter.
   
2. Your web browser, using HTTPS, prepares an HTTP request and pushes it to the layer below it, the transport layer.
   
3. The TCP layer needs to establish a connection via a three-way handshake between your browser and the TryHackMe web server. After establishing the TCP connection, it can send the HTTP request containing the search query. Each TCP segment created is sent to the layer below it, the Internet layer.
   
4. The IP layer adds the source IP address, i.e., your computer, and the destination IP address, i.e., the IP address of the TryHackMe web server. For this packet to reach the router, your laptop delivers it to the layer below it, the link layer.
   
5. Depending on the protocol, The link layer adds the proper link layer header and trailer, and the packet is sent to the router.
   
6. The router removes the link layer header and trailer, inspects the IP destination, among other fields, and routes the packet to the proper link. Each router repeats this process until it reaches the router of the target server.

The steps will then be reversed as the packet reaches the router of the destination network. As we cover additional protocols, we will revisit this exercise and create a more in-depth version.

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

The idea behind NAT lies in using **one public IP address** to provide Internet access to **many private IP addresses**. In other words, if you are connecting a company with twenty computers, you can provide Internet access to all twenty computers by using a single public IP address instead of twenty public IP addresses. (Note: _Technically speaking, the number of IP addresses is always expressed as a power of two. To be technically accurate, with NAT, you reserve two public IP addresses instead of thirty-two. Consequently, you would have saved thirty public IP addresses._)

Unlike routing, which is the natural way to route packets to the destination host, routers that support NAT must find a way to track ongoing connections. Consequently, NAT-supporting routers maintain a table translating network addresses between internal and external networks. Generally, the internal network would use a private IP address range, while the external network would use a public IP address.

In the diagram below, multiple devices access the Internet via a router that supports NAT. The router maintains a table that maps the internal IP address and port number with its external IP address and port number. For instance, the laptop might establish a connection with some web server. From the laptop perspective, the connection is initiated from its IP address `192.168.0.129` from TCP source port number `15401`; however, the web server will see this same connection as being established from `212.3.4.5` and TCP port number `19273`, as shown in the translation table. The router does this address translation seamlessly.

![A private network connects to the Internet via a router that supports NAT. The router maintains a translation table for the ongoing connections.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719849362861.svg)

## DNS: Remembering Addresses

Do you remember the IP addresses of your favourite websites? Unless it is a private IP address of a local device, no one needs to worry about memorizing IP addresses. This is in part due to the Domain Name System (DNS), which is responsible for properly mapping a domain name to an IP address.

DNS operates at the Application Layer, i.e., Layer 7 of the ISO OSI model. DNS traffic uses UDP port 53 by default and TCP port 53 as a default fallback. There are many types of DNS records; however, in this task, we will focus on the following four:

- **A record**: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set `example.com` to resolve to `172.17.2.172`.
- **AAAA Record**: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to _Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting_; neither falls under DNS.
- **CNAME Record**: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, `www.example.com` can be mapped to `example.com` or even to `example.org`.
- **MX Record**: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

In other words, when you type `example.com` in your browser, your browser tries to resolve this domain name by querying the DNS server for the A record. However, when you try to send an email to `test@example.com`, the mail server would query the DNS server to find the MX record.

If you want to look up the IP address of a domain from the command line, you can use a tool such as `nslookup`. Consider the example in the terminal below where we look up `example.com`.

Terminal

```
nslookup www.example.com
```

The query above led to four packets. In the terminal below, we can see that the first and third packets send DNS queries for the A and AAAA records, respectively. The second and fourth packets show the DNS query responses.

---

## WHOIS

In the previous task, we covered how a domain name is resolved into an IP address. However, for this to happen, someone needs to have the authority to set the A, AAAA, and MX records, among other DNS records for the domain. Whoever registers a domain name is granted this power. Therefore, if you register example.com, you can set any valid DNS records for example.com.

You can register any available domain name for one or more years. You need to pay the annual fee, and you are required to provide [accurate contact information](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/whois-data-accuracy-2017-06-20-en) as the registrant. This information is part of the data available via WHOIS records and is available publicly. (Although written in uppercase, WHOIS is not an acronym; it is pronounced _who is_.) However, don’t worry if you want to register a domain without revealing your contact information publicly; you can use one of the privacy services that hide all your information from the WHOIS records.

You can look up the WHOIS records of any registered domain name using one of the online services or via the command-line tool `whois`, available on Linux systems, among others. As expected, a WHOIS record provides information about the entity that registered a domain name, including name, phone number, email, and address. In the screenshot shown below, you can see when the record was first created and when it was last updated. Moreover, you can find the registrant’s name, address, phone, and email.

## Secure Protocols

Networking secure protocols are designed to protect data transmitted over a network. They ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, preventing unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Common examples include **TLS/SSL**, **IPsec**, **SSH**, and **HTTPS**, each operating at different layers of the network stack to provide varying levels of security. 

**Types of Secure Protocols:**

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):**
    
    These protocols encrypt data transmitted between applications, like web browsers and servers (HTTPS), or email clients and servers (SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS). 
    
- **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec):**
    
    Operates at the network layer to secure IP packets, providing encryption, authentication, and key management for network traffic. 
    
- **Secure Shell (SSH):**
    
    Enables secure remote access to network devices, encrypting communication and providing authentication to prevent unauthorized access. 
    
- **Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) & Pretty Good Privacy (PGP):**
    
    These protocols focus on email security, providing encryption and authentication for email communication. 
    
- **HTTPS:**
    
    A secure version of the HTTP protocol, using TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between web browsers and web servers. 
    
- **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):**
    
    Provides secure file transfer capabilities using the SSH protocol, commonly used for uploading and downloading files securely. 
    
- **FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure):**
    
    Secures FTP communication using TLS/SSL, similar to HTTPS, providing encryption for file transfers. 
    
- **Kerberos:**
    
    Authenticates requests between trusted hosts on a network. 
    
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3):**
    
    Secures network management operations by providing encryption and authentication for network devices. 
    
- **Secure Electronic Transaction (SET):**
    
    Designed for secure credit card transactions over the internet. 
    

These protocols are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of data transmitted across networks, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

**Advantages of network security protocols**

- Ensure data privacy by encryption

- Protect network traffic from third parties

- Help comply with regulation

- Allow for flexibility and scalability

**Disadvantages of network security protocols**

- It might require specialized knowledge and expertise

- Can introduce latency and processing overhead

- Might not be fully compatible with devices

- Can be costly for organizations


### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that secures communication over networks by providing **confidentiality** and **integrity**. It operates at the **Transport Layer** of the OSI model. TLS is an evolution of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), with TLS 1.3 being the latest version, introduced in 2018.

**Example**:  
In the 1990s, before TLS, attackers could easily capture unencrypted data, such as login credentials, simply by intercepting network traffic. With the introduction of SSL and later TLS, sensitive information like usernames and passwords is encrypted during transmission.

**Key Concepts**:

- TLS secures data at the **Transport Layer** of the OSI model.
- When implemented, it encrypts all data exchanged between a client and a server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

When you visit a website with `https://` in the address, it's using **TLS** (not SSL, even though people still call it SSL sometimes).

#### Certificates in TLS

Before secure communication begins, a server (or client) needs a signed **TLS certificate** to verify its identity. This certificate is issued by a **Certificate Authority (CA)** after the server submits a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**.

**Key Points**:

- **Trusted Certificates**: Certificates from trusted CAs are automatically recognized by web browsers.
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: These are not recommended for verifying authenticity, as they are not validated by a third party.

**Example**:  
Many websites use trusted certificates issued by CAs like Let’s Encrypt, which offers free certificates. Self-signed certificates may be used for internal or testing purposes but are less secure.

 However, [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) allows you to get your certificate signed for free.

### HTTPS

HTTP relies on TCP and uses port 80 by default. We also saw how all HTTP traffic was sent in cleartext for anyone to intercept and monitor. 

The screenshot below is from the previous room, and it gives a clear idea of how an adversary can easily read all the traffic exchanged between the client and the server.

Let’s take a minute to review the most common steps before a web browser can request a page over HTTP. After resolving the domain name to an IP address, the client will carry out the following two steps:

1. Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
2. Communicate using the HTTP protocol; for example, issue HTTP requests, such as `GET / HTTP/1.1`

The two steps described above are shown in the window below. The three packets for the TCP handshake (marked with 1) precede the first HTTP packet with `GET` in it. The HTTP communication is marked with 2. The last three displayed packets are for TCP connection termination and are marked with 3.

#### HTTP Over TLS

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is basically HTTP over TLS. Consequently, requesting a page over HTTPS will require the following three steps (after resolving the domain name):

1. Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
2. Establish a TLS session
3. Communicate using the HTTP protocol; for example, issue HTTP requests, such as `GET / HTTP/1.1`

The screenshot below shows that a TCP session is established in the first three packets, marked with 1. Then, several packets are exchanged to negotiate the TLS protocol, marked with 2. Finally, HTTP application data is exchanged, marked with 3. Looking at the Wireshark screenshot, we see that it says “Application Data” because there is no way to know if it is indeed HTTP or some other protocol sent over port 443.

As expected, if one tries to follow the stream of packets and combine all their contents, they will only get gibberish, as shown in the screenshot below. The exchanged traffic is encrypted; the red is sent by the client, and the blue is sent by the server. There is no way to know the contents without acquiring the encryption key.

#### Getting the Encryption Key

Adding TLS to HTTP leads to all the packets being encrypted. We can no longer see the contents of the exchanged packets unless we get access to the private key. Although it is improbable that we will have access to the keys used for encryption in a TLS session, we repeated the above screenshots after providing the decryption key to Wireshark. The TCP and TLS handshakes don’t change; the main difference starts with the HTTP protocol marked 3. For instance, we can see when the client issues a `GET`.

If you want to see the data exchanged, now is your chance! It is still regular HTTP traffic hidden from prying eyes.

The key takeaway is that TLS offered security for HTTP without requiring any changes in the lower or higher layer protocols. In other words, TCP and IP were not modified, while HTTP was sent over TLS the way it would be sent over TCP.



### SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS

Adding TLS to protocols like **SMTP**, **POP3**, and **IMAP** secures email communication. These protocols become **SMTPS**, **POP3S**, and **IMAPS** respectively, ensuring email data is encrypted as it travels across the network.

- **SMTPS**: Secure Mail Transfer Protocol over TLS.
- **POP3S**: Secure Post Office Protocol (email retrieval) over TLS.
- **IMAPS**: Secure Internet Message Access Protocol (email synchronization) over TLS.

The insecure versions use the default TCP port numbers shown in the table below:

The secure versions, i.e., over TLS, use the following TCP port numbers by default:

**Example**:  
Using IMAPS ensures that emails you read on multiple devices (like a phone and laptop) are synchronized securely, preventing eavesdroppers from accessing sensitive information.


### SSH

**SSH** (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely log in to remote systems. It provides encrypted communication, which protects the integrity and confidentiality of the connection. SSH replaced older, insecure methods like Telnet, where all data, including passwords, was sent in cleartext.

OpenSSH offers several benefits. We will list a few key points:

- **Secure authentication**: Besides password-based authentication, SSH supports public key and two-factor authentication.
- **Confidentiality**: OpenSSH provides end-to-end encryption, protecting against eavesdropping. Furthermore, it notifies you of new server keys to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Integrity**: In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the exchanged data, cryptography also protects the integrity of the traffic.
- **Tunneling**: SSH can create a secure “tunnel” to route other protocols through SSH. This setup leads to a VPN-like connection.
- **X11 Forwarding**: If you connect to a Unix-like system with a graphical user interface, SSH allows you to use the graphical application over the network.

You would issue the command:

```
ssh username@hostname
```

to connect to an SSH server. If the username is the same as your logged-in username, you only need `ssh hostname`. Then, you will be asked for a password; however, if public-key authentication is used, you will be logged in immediately.


### SFTP and FTPS

**SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and **FTPS** (File Transfer Protocol Secure) both provide secure ways to transfer files, but they use different underlying technologies.

- **SFTP**: Part of the SSH protocol suite, operating on **port 22**.
- **FTPS**: Uses TLS for security, similar to HTTPS, and typically operates on **port 990**.

**Example**:

```
sftp user@hostname
```

This command establishes a secure file transfer session using SFTP, ensuring that all file uploads and downloads are encrypted.


### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure tunnel between a client and a VPN server, allowing users to access remote networks as if they were directly connected. VPNs are widely used by companies to allow employees to securely access internal resources from remote locations.

**Key Features**:

- **Encryption**: VPNs encrypt all traffic between the client and server.
- **Anonymity**: VPN users appear to be coming from the VPN server’s IP address rather than their actual location.

**Example**:  
A remote employee can use a VPN to connect securely to their company’s network and access shared files and applications, just as if they were in the office.

Once a VPN tunnel is established, all our Internet traffic will usually be routed over the VPN connection, i.e. via the VPN tunnel. Consequently, when we try to access an Internet service or web application, they will not see our public IP address but the VPN server’s. This is why some Internet users connect over VPN to circumvent geographical restrictions. Furthermore, the local ISP will only see encrypted traffic, which limits its ability to censor Internet access.

In other words, if a user connects to a VPN server in Japan, they will appear to the servers they access as if located in Japan. These servers will customise their experience accordingly, such as redirecting them to the Japanese version of the service. The screenshot below shows the Google Search page after connecting to a VPN server in Japan.
