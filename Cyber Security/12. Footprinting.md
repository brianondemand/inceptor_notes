Footprinting in Security terms is the process of gathering data about the target system which can be utilized to execute or hack the system or target organization.


 Likewise, if you an ethical hacker or someone who is trying to explore the vulnerability of any given site, you need to know about your target very well before manipulating what's inside, You need to have certain information about your target, which is known as Footprinting. 

There are two types of Footprinting:

### 1\. Active Footprinting

Active Footprinting is a process of collecting information by directly communication with the concerned personal or the machine.

### 2\. Passive Footprinting

Passive Footprinting is a process of collecting information about any victim without any direct communication. This can be done using various google search or public reports.

1. Collect Network Information
2. Collect System Information
3. Collect Personal/Organization Information

Now let's take a look at the tools and ways to perform footprinting.

### 1. `Search Engine `

It all starts from our browser. Everything you need is available on the internet. Let us suppose we are trying to gather information about **Cisco**. All you need to do is, go to your browser and enter "Cisco" in the search box. You will now get the URL, which is the first piece of information you have.

![Search Engine](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Flinux%2Ffootprinting%2Ffootprinting2.png&w=2048&q=75)

Not just limiting to URL but, proper search can also help attacker to extract information about a target such as technology platform, employee details, login pages, internet portals, etc. which helps in performing social engineering and other types of attacks.

---
### 2. `Ping` 

After some google searches, you will get domain name and other information about your target like `hkrhasan.com`

As you have the url of your target, you can now get the ip of the url with **Ping** Command.

**Example** -

![Ping](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Flinux%2Ffootprinting%2Ffootprinting3.png&w=1920&q=75)

---
### 3. `Whois` Lookup

Whois Lookup is a tool used to find out information such as **DNS**, **domain name**, **name servers**, **IP addresses** etc. You 137.74.187.102 can simply click [here](https://whois.domaintools.com/) and enter you target ip or domain name.

![Whois Lookup](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Flinux%2Ffootprinting%2Ffootprinting4.png&w=1920&q=75)

This search will display the various information about the target.

![Whois Lookup](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Flinux%2Ffootprinting%2Ffootprinting5.png&w=1920&q=75)

![Whois Lookup](https://www.hkrhasan.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Flinux%2Ffootprinting%2Ffootprinting6.png&w=1920&q=75)

Or you can also simply use the command `whois` in **Kali Linux**.

### 4. **`Nslookup`** 

Nslookup queries the specified **DNS** server and retrieves the requested records that are associated with the domain name you provided. This command gives you the information about the domain name's IP address.

 **Basic Syntax**

```sh
nslookup [options] [domain]
```

 **Basic DNS Lookup**

Retrieve the default IP address for a domain:

```sh
nslookup example.com
```

 _This returns the IP address of the domain using the default DNS resolver._

 **Querying a Specific DNS Server**

Use a particular DNS server (e.g., Google's 8.8.8.8):

```sh
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
```

 _This queries Google's public DNS server for the domainâ€™s IP address._

**Finding MX (Mail Exchange) Records**

Retrieve mail servers for a domain:

```sh
nslookup -type=MX example.com
```

**Getting Name Server (NS) Records**

Find authoritative name servers:

```sh
nslookup -type=NS example.com
```

**Querying TXT Records (e.g., SPF, DKIM, and Verification)**

```sh
nslookup -type=TXT example.com
```

 **Reverse DNS Lookup**

Find the domain name associated with an IP address:

```sh
nslookup 8.8.8.8
```

 _This returns the domain name associated with the IP._

**Interactive Mode (`nslookup` Shell)**

Enter interactive mode by typing `nslookup` alone:

```sh
nslookup
> example.com  
> set type=MX  
> example.com  
```

_This allows multiple queries without retyping `nslookup` each time._

### 5. `dig` Command

The `dig` (Domain Information Groper) command is a powerful tool used for querying DNS (Domain Name System) records. It helps in retrieving various DNS information about a domain, such as IP addresses, mail servers, and name servers.

---

 **Basic Syntax**

```sh
dig [options] [domain] [record_type]
```



 **Basic DNS Lookup**

To retrieve the A (IPv4) record of a domain:

```sh
dig example.com
```

or explicitly specify the A record:

```sh
dig example.com A
```

**Querying Other Record Types**

- **MX (Mail Exchange) records**:

    ```sh
   dig example.com MX
    ```

- **NS (Name Server) records**:

```sh
  dig example.com NS
 ```

- **TXT (Text) records** (used for SPF, DKIM, etc.):

```sh
 dig example.com TXT
 ```

- **CNAME (Canonical Name) records**:

```sh
  dig www.example.com CNAME
```

**Reverse DNS Lookup**

Find the domain associated with an IP:

```sh
dig -x 8.8.8.8
```

**Querying a Specific DNS Server**

Use a specific nameserver (e.g., Google's 8.8.8.8):

```sh
dig @8.8.8.8 example.com
```

**Retrieving Only the Answer Section**

For a cleaner output:

```sh
dig example.com +short
```

**Checking the SOA (Start of Authority) Record**

Find domain administrative details:

```sh
dig example.com SOA
```

**Checking All Available Records**

```sh
dig example.com ANY
```

_(Note: Many DNS servers do not respond to ANY queries for security reasons.)_

**Tracing DNS Resolution Path**

To see how the query is resolved step by step:

```sh
dig example.com +trace
```

---

**Example Output of `dig example.com A`**

```
; <<>> DiG 9.16.1 <<>> example.com A
;; global options: +cmd
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.    86400   IN  A 93.184.216.34
```

- The **ANSWER SECTION** shows the resolved IP address.

---

 **Why Use `dig`?**

- Useful for troubleshooting DNS issues  
- Helps verify DNS record changes  
- Works across Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or BIND tools)
