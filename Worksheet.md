## Setting Page Margin using CSS

The margin property defines the space around an HTML element. It is possible to use negative values to overlap content. The values of the margin property are not inherited by the child elements. Remember that the adjacent vertical margins (top and bottom margins) will collapse into each other so that the distance between the blocks is not the sum of the margins, but only the greater of the two margins or the same size as one margin if both are equal. We have the following properties to set an element margin.

```

```
## Setting Display Using CSS 

The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout. The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed. Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. A block element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline element.

The values of display property have the following meanings: 

Block -This value causes an element to generate a block box. 

Inline-block - This value causes an element to generate an inline-level block container. The inside of an inline-block is formatted as a block box, and the element itself is formatted as an atomic inline-level box. 

Inline - This value causes an element to generate one or more inline boxes.  list-item - This value causes an element (e.g., LI in HTML) to generate a principal block box and a marker box. 

None - This value causes an element to not appear in the formatting structure

```


```

## Setting width and Maxwidth using CSS 

Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins: 

`This element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.` 


Note: The problem with the above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page. 

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices: 

This element has a max-width of 500px, and margin set to auto. 

Tip: Resize the browser window to less than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!
