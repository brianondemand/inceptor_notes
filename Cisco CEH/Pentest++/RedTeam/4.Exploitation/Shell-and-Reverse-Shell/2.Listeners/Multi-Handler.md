
## Multi/Handler (Metasploit)

Module
```Metasploit
auxiliary/multi/handler
```

- The `auxiliary/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells. Due to being part of the Metasploit framework, multi/handler provides a fully-fledged way to obtain stable shells, with a wide variety of further options to improve the caught shell. It's also the only way to interact with a _meterpreter_ shell, and is the easiest way to handle _staged_ payloads -- both of which we will look at in task 9.
