Info
	Some exploit suggesting scripts (e.g. winPEAS) will require you to upload them to the target system and run them there. This may cause antivirus software to detect and delete them. To avoid making unnecessary noise that can attract attention, you may prefer to use WES-NG, which will run on your attacking machine (e.g. Kali or TryHackMe AttackBox).


Metasploit
```MSFconsole
multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

Info
	If you already have a Meterpreter shell on the target system, you can use the `multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` module to list vulnerabilities that may affect the target system and allow you to elevate your privileges on the target system.
