
## Token Impersonation

What are tokens?
- Temporary keys that allow you access to a system/network without having to provide credentials each time you access a file. Think cookies for computers.

Two types:
- Delegate: Created for logging into a machine or using Remote Desktop
- Impersonate: "non-interactive" such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script
