## ##  **Constraints**
Reject & accept specific data

```
CREATE TABLE celebs (  
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,  
   name TEXT UNIQUE,  
   date_of_birth TEXT NOT NULL,  
   date_of_death TEXT DEFAULT 'Not Applicable'  
);
```

1. `PRIMARY KEY` columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a _constraint violation_ which will not allow you to insert the new row.

2. `UNIQUE` columns have a different value for every row. This is similar to `PRIMARY KEY` except a table can have many different `UNIQUE` columns.

3. `NOT NULL` columns must have a value. Attempts to insert a row without a value for a `NOT NULL` column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.

4. `DEFAULT` columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.
