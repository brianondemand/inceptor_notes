***Routing** is the process that routers use to determine the path that IP packets should take over a network to reach their destination. When a router receives a packet, it’s the router’s job to forward the packet to the correct destination. 


- **Hop**: The number of routers a packet passes through before reaching its destination.
- **Subnet**: A smaller section of a network.
- **Gateway**: The next router or device that forwards packets.
- **Metric**: A value that routers use to determine the best path (e.g., distance, speed, reliability).

Routers store routes to all of their known destinations in a routing table. When routers receive packets, they look in the routing table to find the best route to forward the packets.

*A **route** is an instruction to the router. A route tells the router: to send a packet to destination X, you should send the packet to next-hop Y. Next hop means the next router in the path to the destination.

Or, if the destination is directly connected to the router, send the packet directly to the destination. Or, if the destination is the router’s own IP address, receive the packet for yourself, do not forward it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how routing works:

  
- **Step 1**. Packet Creation: A data packet is created at the source, which includes information such as the destination IP address, source IP address, and other control data.
  
- **Step 2**. Forwarding Decision: Once a router receives the packet, the router reads the destination IP address and checks its routing table to decide where to forward the packet. The routing table contains a list of networks and their corresponding paths.
  
- **Step 3**. Route Selection: Routers use routing protocols and metrics to determine the best path for the packet. If there are multiple routes available, the router will choose the most efficient one based on factors like distance, cost, and congestion.
  
- **Sep 4**. Packet Forwarding: Once the best route is selected, the router forwards the packet to the next router or the destination device. The process may be repeated several times as the packet hops from router to router until it reaches its destination.
  
- **Step 5**. Packet Delivery: Upon reaching the final router in the path, the packet is delivered to the destination device on the local network.

  

This routing process ensures that data flows seamlessly across complex networks, even in cases of network failure or congestion.

### Types of Routing

Routing is typically of 3 types, each serving its purpose and offering different functionalities.

![Types-of-Routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240713185448/Types-of-Routing.jpg)



### 1. Static Routing

Static routing is also called as “non-adaptive routing”. In this, routing configuration is done manually by the network administrator. Let’s say for example, we have 5 different routes to transmit data from one node to another, so the network administrator will have to manually enter the routing information by assessing all the routes.

**Advantages of Static Routing**

- No routing overhead for the router CPU which means a cheaper router can be used to do routing.
  
- It adds security because only an only administrator can allow routing to particular networks only.
  
- No bandwidth usage between routers.


**Disadvantage of Static Routing**

- For a large network, it is a hectic task for administrators to manually add each route for the network in the routing table on each router.
  
- The administrator should have good knowledge of the topology. If a new administrator comes, then he has to manually add each route so he should have very good knowledge of the routes of the topology.

#### Configuration of Static Routing

![static-routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241120114334240383/static-routing.jpg)

R1 having IP address 172.16.10.6/30 on s0/0/1, 192.168.20.1/24 on fa0/0.   
R2 having IP address 172.16.10.2/30 on s0/0/0, 192.168.10.1/24 on fa0/0.   
R3 having IP address 172.16.10.5/30 on s0/1, 172.16.10.1/30 on s0/0, 10.10.10.1/24 on fa0/0. 

Now because only static routes for router R3: 

```
R3(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.2
R3(config)#ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.6
```

Here, provided the route for the 192.168.10.0 network where 192.168.10.0 is its network I’d and 172.16.10.2 and 172.16.10.6 are the next-hop address.   
Now, configuring for R2: 

```
R2(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.1
R2(config)#ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.1
R2(config)#ip route 172.16.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.1
```

Similarly for R1: 

```
R1(config)#ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.5
R1(config)#ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.5
R1(config)#ip route 172.16.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.10.5
```


### 2. Default Routing

This is the method where the router is configured to send all packets toward a single router (next hop). It doesn’t matter to which network the packet belongs, it is forwarded out to the router which is configured for default routing. It is generally used with stub routers. A stub router is a router that has only one route to reach all other networks. 

**Advantages of Default Routing**

- Default routing provides a “last resort” route for packets that don’t match any specific route in the routing table. It ensures that packets are not dropped and can reach their intended destination.
  
- It simplifies network configuration by reducing the need for complex routing tables.
  
- Default routing improves network reliability and reduces packet loss.

**Disadvantages of Default Routing**

- Relying solely on default routes can lead to inefficient routing, as it doesn’t consider specific paths.
- Using default routes may introduce additional network latency.


#### Configuration of Dynamic Routing

Using the same topology which we have used for static routing before.

![dynamic-routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241120114423291323/dynamic-routing.jpg)

In this topology, R1 and R2 are stub routers so we can configure default routing for both these routers.  Configuring default routing for R1: 

```
R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  172.16.10.5
```

Now configuring default routing for R2: 

```
R2(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0  172.16.10.1
```


### 3. Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing makes automatic adjustments of the routes according to the current state of the route in the routing table. Dynamic routing uses protocols to discover network destinations and the routes to reach them. **RIP** and **OSPF** are the best examples of dynamic routing protocols. Automatic adjustments will be made to reach the network destination if one route goes down. A dynamic protocol has the following features: 

- The routers should have the same dynamic protocol running in order to exchange routes.
- When a router finds a change in the topology then the router advertises it to all other routers.


**Advantages of Dynamic Routing**

- Easy to configure.
  
- More effective at selecting the best route to a destination remote network and also for discovering remote networks.


**Disadvantage of Dynamic Routing**

- Consumes more bandwidth for communicating with other neighbors.
  
- Less secure than static routing.

### Routing Table

A routing table is a crucial data structure used by routers to store information about network paths. It contains entries that map destination IP addresses to their corresponding next-hop addresses and metrics, such as cost or distance.

When a router receives a data packet, it consults the routing table to determine the most efficient path for forwarding the packet to its destination, ensuring optimal network performance and connectivity.
### Routing Protocols

Routing protocols are the sets of rules used by routers to communicate with each other and share information about the network's topology.

Different protocols serve different purposes, and each has unique characteristics suited to various network environments.

|Routing Protocol|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Routing Information Protocol (RIP)|Distance Vector|An early protocol that uses hop count to determine the best path, suitable for small networks.|
|Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)|Link State|A widely used protocol that finds the best path using a complete network topology.|
|Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)|Hybrid|Combines features of distance vector and link state protocols for efficient routing.|
|Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)|Path Vector|Manages how packets are routed across the internet through multiple autonomous systems.|
|Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)|Distance Vector|Developed by Cisco, it uses metrics like bandwidth and delay for routing decisions.|
|Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)|Link State|A protocol used in large networks, similar to OSPF but operates at the data link layer.|
|Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2)|Distance Vector|An improved version of RIP that supports classless routing and includes security features.|
### Routing Metrics

Routing metrics are the values used by routing protocols to determine the best path for data packets. Different routing protocols use different metrics, and some combine multiple metrics into a single composite value. Common routing metrics include:

  
**1. Hop Count:** The number of routers (hops) a packet passes through to reach its destination. Protocols like RIP use hop count as the primary metric, with fewer hops being preferred.
  
**2. Bandwidth:** The data transfer capacity of a link, often measured in bits per second (bps). OSPF uses bandwidth as a key metric to select faster links.
  
**3. Delay:** The time it takes for a packet to traverse a path. Lower delay is preferable, especially for time-sensitive applications like video conferencing.
  
**4. Cost:** A composite metric that may factor in various attributes like bandwidth, delay, and financial cost. OSPF uses cost as its main metric, allowing for more sophisticated path selection.
  
**5. Load:** Refers to the amount of traffic already present on a link. A high load may cause congestion, so lightly loaded paths are preferred.
  
**6. Reliability**: The stability and error rate of a network link. More reliable links are prioritized for critical data transmission.

**Advantages of Routing**
  
**1. Efficient Data Transmission:** Routing ensures that data travels via the most efficient path, reducing latency and congestion.
  
**2. Scalability:** Dynamic routing protocols allow networks to grow without requiring extensive manual configuration.

**3. Network Redundancy:** Routers can automatically reroute traffic in case of a link failure, ensuring high availability.
  
**4. Load Balancing:** Some routing protocols support load balancing, distributing traffic evenly across multiple paths to avoid bottlenecks.
  
**5. Security:** Routers often come with security features such as firewalls and VPNs, providing additional protection for network traffic.

**Disadvantages of Routing**

**1. Complexity:** Dynamic routing protocols can be complex to configure and maintain, especially in large networks.
  
**2. Resource Consumption:** Routers consume processing power and bandwidth to maintain and update routing tables, which can impact performance.
  
**3. Latency in Path Selection:** In dynamic routing, the process of recalculating routes can introduce latency, especially in real-time applications.
  
**4. Vulnerability to Attacks:** Routers can be vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as routing table poisoning, which can lead to network outages or data interception.

Routers store information about destinations they know in their routing table. 

When routers receive packets, they look in the routing table to find the best route to forward the packet.

Each route in the routing table is an instruction. The routing table is a set of instructions for the router, telling it how to forward packets. 

A route tells the router, to reach destinations in network X, send the packet to next-hop Y, which is the next router in the path to the destination. To reach destination X, send packets to next-hop Y.

When you configure an IP address on an interface and enable the interface, two routes are automatically added to the routing table. 

>The first is a **Connected route**, indicated with code C in the routing table. It is a route to the network connected to the interface. 

- For example, if the interface’s IP is 192.168.1.1/24, the connected route will be to 1.0/24.

- It tells the router: to send a packet to a destination in this network, send it out of the interface specified in the route. 

>The second kind of route is a **Local route**, indicated by code L in the routing table. It’s a route to the exact IP address configured on the interface. 

- So, if the interface’s IP is 192.168.1.1/24, the local route will be to 1.1/32. A /32 netmask is used to specify just the one IP address.

- This tells the router, packets to this destination are for you, and you should receive them for yourself and not forward them.

Routes match destinations. A route matches a destination if the packet’s destination IP address is part of the network specified in the route. 

- For example, a packet to 192.168.1.60 is matched by a route to 192.168.1.0/24, but not by a route to 192.168.0.0/24. 

If a router receives a packet and it does not have a route that matches the packet’s destination, it will drop the packet. 

- This is different from switches, which flood frames if they don’t have a MAC table entry for the destination. 

If a router receives a packet and it has multiple routes that match the packet’s destination, it will use the most specific matching route to forward the packet.

- The most specific matching route means the matching route with the longest prefix length.

- This is different from switches, which look for an exact match in the MAC address table to forward frames. The frame’s destination MAC address must be the exact same as the entry in the MAC address table. There’s no concept of “most specific match” in switches.

## Command review
