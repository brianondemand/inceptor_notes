## What is a network?

**A computer network is a digital telecommunications network allows NODES to share RESOURCES.**

**A CLIENT is a device that accesses a service made available by a SERVER.**

**A SERVER is a device that provides functions or services for CLIENTS.**

- Note : The same device can be a CLIENT in some situations and a SERVER in other situations. Ex: A Peer-to-Peer network.

**Networking devices** are hardware components used to establish, manage, and maintain networks. These devices help facilitate communication between devices in a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the internet. Below are some common types of networking devices:


# Network Devices

### 1. **Router**

A router connects different networks, such as a home or business network to the internet. It routes data between these networks, allowing devices within a local network to communicate with each other and with external networks.

**Example:** A Wi-Fi router in a home network, directing traffic between devices like smartphones, computers, and the internet.

### 2. **Switch**

A switch is used to connect multiple devices within a single network. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and forwards data to devices based on MAC addresses. It improves network efficiency by directing data only to the destination device, rather than broadcasting it to all devices.

**Example:** A network switch in an office connecting computers, printers, and servers within a local network.

### 3. **Hub**

A hub is a simple networking device that connects multiple devices within a network. Unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts data to all devices, which can cause network inefficiency, especially in large networks.

**Example:** An older or small office network where a hub connects various devices.

### 4. **Access Point (AP)**

An access point allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It is often used in larger networks or homes where devices like smartphones and laptops need wireless connectivity.

**Example:** A Wi-Fi access point in a home providing internet connectivity to smartphones, laptops, and tablets.

### 5. **Modem**

A modem (modulator-demodulator) connects a local network to the internet by converting the digital data from a computer into a signal that can be transmitted over phone lines, cable systems, or fiber optics.

**Example:** A cable modem used by internet service providers (ISPs) to provide internet access to homes or businesses.

### 6. **Bridge**

A bridge connects two separate networks to work as a single network. It operates at the data link layer and helps segment traffic in large networks to reduce congestion.

**Example:** A bridge connecting two Wi-Fi networks in a large building.

### 7. **Firewall**

A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks, such as the internet, protecting the internal network from threats.

**Example:** A hardware firewall protecting a corporate network from external attacks.

### 8. **Gateway**

A gateway acts as a translator between two different network protocols, allowing communication between different types of networks. It often includes routing and firewall functions.

**Example:** A gateway connecting an office's internal network to the public internet, especially in scenarios involving VPNs or private network communication.
