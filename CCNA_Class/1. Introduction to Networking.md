**Networking:** Networking involves connecting multiple devices to share resources, exchange information, and communicate effectively.

**Protocols** are rules that govern how devices communicate and share information across a network. Examples of protocols include: 

- IP – Internet Protocol 
- HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 
- SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- TCP – Transmission Control Protocol
- UDP – User Datagram Protocol

**Network reference models**: were developed to allow products from different manufacturers to interoperate on a network. 

A network reference model serves as a blueprint, detailing standards for how protocol communication should occur.

**Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)**: The OSI model, with its seven layers, provides a standardized and comprehensive view of network communication.

**Department of Defense (DoD)**: the DoD model, with its four layers, is a simpler representation that closely aligns with the TCP/IP protocol suite, the foundation of the internet.

## Types of Networks

This section outlines the three primary types of computer networks, each distinguished by its geographic scope and purpose:

#### **1. Local Area Network (LAN)**

* **A LAN is a high-speed network confined to a relatively small geographic area, typically within a single building or a cluster of closely located buildings. **

* **Characteristics:**
    * High bandwidth (fast data transfer speeds)
    * Low latency (minimal delays in data transmission)
    * Often privately owned and managed
* **Examples:**
    * A network connecting computers within a single office 
    * A network connecting devices in a home 

#### **2. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

* **A WAN interconnects multiple LANs across a broad geographical area, often spanning cities, regions, or even continents.**

* **Characteristics:**
    * Typically relies on leased telecommunication lines (e.g., dedicated lines, leased lines) or public networks (e.g., the internet)
    * Can have varying bandwidth and latency depending on the underlying infrastructure
* **Examples:**
    * A company's internal network connecting its headquarters with branch offices in different cities
    * The internet itself, which is a global WAN

#### **3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

* **A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically encompassing a city or a large campus.**

* **Characteristics:**
    * Can offer higher bandwidth than traditional WAN connections but may have higher costs
    * Often used to interconnect government offices, universities, or businesses within a city
* **Examples:**
    * A network connecting government buildings within a city
    * A university network connecting its various campuses and departments

#### **4. Internetworks**

An internetwork is a general term describing multiple networks connected together. The Internet is the largest and most well-known internetwork.

**SAN (Storage Area Network) provides systems with high-speed, lossless access to high-capacity storage devices.**

**A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows for information to be securely sent across a public or unsecure network, such as the Internet.**

### **Network Architectures**

A **host** in networking refers to any device connected to a network, assigned a network address, and capable of functioning as a **client**, **server**, or **peer**:

- **Client:** Requests data or services.
- **Server:** Provides data or services.
- **Peer:** Can both request and provide data.

#### **1. Peer-to-Peer Architecture**

 **All hosts can both request and provide data/services (e.g., file sharing between two Windows XP devices).**

- **Advantages:**
    - Simple to configure.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Data management and backups are challenging due to decentralized data storage.
    - Security requires individual user account setup on each device.

---

#### **2. Client/Server Architecture**

**In the client-server architecture, the central server handles data storage, client request processing, network security and access control, while other client devices access resources and communicate with each other through the server. **

- **Advantages:**
    - Centralized data and service management.
    - Improved scalability and security.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - The server can be a single point of failure unless redundancy is implemented.

---

#### **3. Mainframe/Terminal Architecture**

A **mainframe** is a large computer with huge software and hardware resources to handle large data processing. They are mostly used in large companies or organizations

A mainframe stores all data and services, performing all processing for connected dumb terminals.

**Dumb Terminals:** Devices with no processing capability, used only for input/output (e.g., keyboard, display).

- **Advantages:**
    - Centralized management and security of data.
- **Modern Evolution:** Thin-client architecture replicates this model but with advanced devices or software:
    - Thin-clients rely on a central system for most processing tasks.
    - **Benefits:** Cost-effective, scalable, and energy-efficient.
    - **Protocols Used:**
        - **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):** By Microsoft.
        - **ICA (Independent Computer Architecture):** By Citrix.
