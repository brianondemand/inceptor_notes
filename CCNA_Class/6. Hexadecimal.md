Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, which means that it uses 16 different symbols to represent numbers. The symbols used in hexadecimal are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Hexadecimal numbers use **base 16** (digits: 0 to 9 and letters A to F).

- A = 10
- B = 11
- C = 12
- D = 13
- E = 14
- F = 15

Hexadecimal is often used in networking because it is a more efficient way to represent IP addresses and subnet masks. For example, the IP address 192.168.1.1 can be represented in hexadecimal as C0.A8.01.01. This is because a single hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits.

Subnet masks are also often represented in hexadecimal. For example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 can be represented in hexadecimal as FFFFFF00. This is because a single hexadecimal digit can represent eight binary digits.

Using hexadecimal to represent IP addresses and subnet masks makes calculating and understanding subnets easier.


```go
ipconfig /all | more
```

Show all network interfaces one page at a time.

```go
ping default gateway
```

```go
arp -a
```


A default gateway is a network node that forwards data packets to other networks. It's the first stop for data traveling between systems, and it's usually a router. 


Hexadecimal is also used in other networking applications, such as MAC addresses and routing protocols. It is a versatile and efficient number system that is well-suited for networking tasks.

Here are some of the benefits of using hexadecimal in networking:

- It is a more efficient way to represent IP addresses and subnet masks.
- It makes it easier to calculate and understand subnets.
- It is a versatile and efficient number system that is well-suited for networking tasks.

## Binary to Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter

1. **Convert Decimal to Binary**

- Write the decimal number in binary form (base 2).

2. **Group the Binary Digits into Sets of 4**

- Start grouping from the right (add leading zeros if needed to complete groups of 4 bits).

3. **Convert Each Group to Hexadecimal**

- Use a lookup table to convert each 4-bit group directly to its hexadecimal equivalent.

##### Example: Convert **156** to Hexadecimal

**Step 1: Decimal → Binary**

- 156 in binary is 100111001001110010011100.

 **Step 2: Group the Binary Digits (4 bits each)**

- 100111001001110010011100 → 100110011001 110011001100.

 **Step 3: Binary → Hexadecimal**

- 100110011001 = **9**
- 110011001100 = **C**

So, 156156156 in hexadecimal is **9C**.
