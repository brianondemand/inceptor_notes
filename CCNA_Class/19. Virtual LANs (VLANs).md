## LAN switches and BUM traffic

BUM stands for broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast. When a LAN switch receives a frame that belongs to one of these types, it sends the frame to all its ports except the port it received the frame on. This behavior is shown on figure 1.

A broadcast domain includes all connected devices that get a copy of any broadcast, unknown unicast, or multicast (BUM) frame being sent.

By default, all interfaces on a Cisco switch are in the same broadcast domain. Therefore, when a broadcast frame is received on any switch port, the switch forwards it out to all its other ports. Having that logic in mind, to create two separate LANs (like one for servers and one for users), you must use two different switches.

Тhis approach is not scalable, imagine if your organization want to have thousand separate LANs, it has to have thousands of physical switches. This scaling limitation is the reason why Virtual LANs were introduced.

By using VLANs, a single switch can act as two logical switches or creating two broadcast domains. This is done on a port-by-port basis.

The switch will then never forward a frame send by any user to any of the servers and vice-versa because they are part of different broadcast domains.

## Benefits of using VLANs


- **It improves the security** by reducing the number of end-stations that receive copies of BUM traffic.
- **It creates smaller fault domains** by isolating different groups of devices in separate broadcast domains.
- **It reduces the CPU overhead** on each device in the LAN by limiting the number of broadcast frames received.
- **It improves network performance** and speed of failure recovering.
  

## Creating VLANs on a Cisco switch

Cisco switches do not require any initial configuration to work. You just unbox the device, install the cabling, power it up and it works. By default, all interfaces are in VLAN1. This means that all devices connected to the switch are in the same broadcast domain and must be in one subnet.

When you connect multiple default setting switches together, they create a "broadcast domain," meaning all the devices connected to them can communicate with each other easily as long as they're in the same IP subnet. An IP subnet is like a group of devices with similar addresses that can communicate directly. However, sometimes you might need to connect devices that are in different subnets, meaning they can't communicate directly in the same broadcast domain. To solve this, **VLANs** (Virtual Local Area Networks) are used to create smaller, separate network groups within the same physical network, allowing devices in different subnets to communicate properly.

To configure VLANs on a Cisco switch, additional configuration must be added. There are two main steps for creating new VLAN:

- **Step 1**. Create a new VLAN in the switch VLAN database
    - In global configuration mode, we use the **vlan** [vlan 10] command to create the new VLAN in the switch's database.
    - (Optional) In VLAN configuration mode, we use the **name** _[SALES]_ command to assign a name to the VLAN. 
- **Step 2**. Assign interfaces to the newly created VLAN.
    - In global configuration mode, we use the **interface** _[g0/0]_ command to move into the interface configuration mode.
    - We then use the **switchport access vlan** _[10]_  to specify the VLAN number associated with the interface.
    - (Optional) We use **switchport mode access** to make the port always operate as an access port.


**EXAMPLE**

We will create two VLANs - VLAN10 named CLIENTS and VLAN20 named SERVERS and will assign four access ports to each VLAN as shown in below.

First look at the default VLAN database.

```
show vlan brief
```

Note two important things - by default, there are 5 undeletable VLANs. **VLAN1** cannot be deleted but can be used. By default all interfaces of the switch are assigned to it. **VLANs 1002-1005** cannot be deleted and cannot be used. You can see that their status is “unsp” which stands for unsupported. This means that these VLANs are completely unusable these days. They are leftovers from the days of FDDI and Token Rings.

> **FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)** and **Token Ring** are both types of network technologies that were commonly used in local area networks (LANs) before Ethernet and other modern technologies became more prevalent. These technologies were designed to provide a reliable method of communication in a network, but they differ significantly in how they operate and their underlying principles.


Let's create VLAN10 and VLAN20:

```
Switch#  configure terminal 
```

```
Switch(config)#  vlan 10
```

```
Switch(config-vlan)#  name CLIENTS
```

```
Switch(config-vlan)#  exit
```

```
Switch(config)#  vlan 20
```

```
Switch(config-vlan)#  name SERVERS
```

```
Switch(config-vlan)#  end
```

```
Switch#  show vlan brief 
```

If you compare the output of`` show vlan brief`` with the previous one, you can see VLAN10 and VLAN20 are created, but there are no ports assigned to them. All ports are still assigned to the default VLAN 1. 

Assigning interfaces to the newly created VLANs:

```
Switch#  configure terminal
```

```
Switch(config)#  interface range fastEthernet 0/1 - 4
```

```
Switch(config-if-range)#  switchport access vlan 10
```

```
Switch(config-if-range)#  switchport mode access 
```

```
Switch(config-if-range)#  exit
```

```
Switch(config)#  interface range fastEthernet 0/15 - 18
```

```
Switch(config-if-range)#  switchport access vlan 20
```

 ```
 Switch(config-if-range)#  switchport mode access
```

```
Switch(config-if-range)#  end
```

```
Switch#  show vlan brief 
```


See whether clients in VLAN10 can ping each other.

```
ping 192.168.1.11
```

Try to ping one of the servers.

```
ping 10.1.0.1
```

We can see that client 1 cannot ping server 1, because they are part of different VLANs now. The switch acts as two logical switches with the clients connected to logical switch VLAN10 and the servers connected to logical switch VLAN20 as shown below.

To forward data between the VLANs, we need to use either layer 3 switch or a router.

## Summary

- LAN switches forward any BUM frame to all its ports except the port it received the frame on. This process is called **_flooding_**.
- By default all connected devices are in the same broadcast domain (Vlan1). This is a **scaling limitation and security vulnerability**. 
- VLANs were introduced in order to separate device into different broadcast domains.
- A general rule of thumb is that a **VLAN = Broadcast Domain = Subnet**.
- VLANs are configured and assigned **per interface**.
