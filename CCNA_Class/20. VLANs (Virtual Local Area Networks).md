### What is a LAN

A local area network (LAN) is a group of devices (servers, routers, switches, etc.) in a small geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.

LANs can be wired or wireless. Wired LANs usually use Ethernet cables and switches, while wireless LANs use Wi-Fi routers and access points. Some LANs can use both wired and wireless connections for different devices or purposes.

LANs can be connected to other LANs or wide area networks (WANs) via routers or gateways to form larger networks that span multiple locations or regions.

A LAN is a single broadcast domain, including all devices in that broadcast domain.

## Broadcast domains

A broadcast domain is a group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame (having a destination MAC of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by one of the devices in the domain.

PC6, PC7, PC8, SW3, and one of R2’s interfaces constitute one broadcast domain (the blue compartment). If PC6 sends a broadcast frame, SW3 will receive it and flood it to PC7, PC8, and R2. (R2 will not forward the frame. A router will receive a broadcast frame but will not forward it to other networks.)

There are three more broadcast domains, the yellow compartment, the green compartment, and the connection between R1 and R2. If R1 sends a broadcast frame out of its interface which is connected to R2, the frame will be received only by R2.

A switch will never forward traffic directly between two VLANs.

A switch will not forward frames between VLANs directly, it must send the frames to a router first.

## What is a VLAN

A **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** is a way to logically separate devices on a network without requiring physical separation. It allows you to group computers, servers, and other devices into different networks even if they are connected to the same physical switch.

**Why Use VLANs?**

- **Improves Security**: Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly unless explicitly allowed.
- **Better Network Management**: Reduces network congestion by limiting broadcast traffic to specific VLANs.
- **Flexibility**: Devices can be placed in the same VLAN regardless of their physical location.

**Example of a VLAN**

Imagine a company has different departments: **Sales, Engineering, and HR**. Without VLANs, all devices in these departments would be on the same network, meaning:
- Sales computers could communicate directly with HR and Engineering, which may not be ideal for security.
- Broadcast traffic from one department could slow down the entire network.

**With VLANs:**

1. The network admin creates three VLANs:
   - VLAN 10 for **Engineering**
   - VLAN 20 for **HR**
   - VLAN 30 for **Sales**
   
2. Even though all departments are connected to the same physical switch, VLANs keep their network traffic separate.
   
3. If a Sales computer (VLAN 30) wants to communicate with an HR computer (VLAN 20), a router or a Layer 3 switch must handle the communication.

This setup ensures security, reduces congestion, and makes network management easier.

## Explanation of VLAN Communication   


### Communication Within the Same VLAN

- Devices **within the same VLAN** can communicate **directly** because they share the same subnet.
  
	**Example:**  
  
  - **PC1** (VLAN 10) can communicate with another PC in VLAN 10 without any router.
  - **PC2** (VLAN 30) can communicate with other PCs in VLAN 30 without a router.

### Communication Between Different VLANs

- **VLANs cannot communicate with each other directly** because they are separate broadcast domains.
  
- When a device from **VLAN 10** (Engineering) wants to communicate with a device from **VLAN 30** (Sales), the traffic must go through **Router R1**.
  
- The router is performing **Inter-VLAN Routing**, allowing communication between VLANs.

### How Inter-VLAN Communication Works

- When **PC1 (VLAN 10, 192.168.1.0/26)** wants to send data to **PC2 (VLAN 30, 192.168.1.128/26)**:
  
  1. PC1 sends the packet to its **default gateway** (Router R1).
 
  2. The router **receives the packet**, checks the destination subnet, and routes it to VLAN 30.
 
  3. The packet is sent to PC2 in VLAN 30, completing the communication.

**Summary**

- **Same VLAN → Direct communication**  
- **Different VLANs → Routed through R1**  
- **Router enables inter-VLAN communication**

### Types of VLANs
   
   
   - **Default VLAN**: Usually VLAN 1, where all ports belong by default.  
     
   - **Data VLAN**: Used for user-generated traffic (e.g., Engineering, Sales VLANs).  
     
   - **Voice VLAN**: Optimized for VoIP traffic.  
     
   - **Management VLAN**: Used for network management (e.g., switch configuration).  
     
   - **Native VLAN**: Used for untagged traffic on trunk ports.  

### Port Types

#### Access Port: 

An **access port** is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts such as computers, printers, and servers. It is called an access port because it gives the end hosts access to the network.

#### Trunk Port: 

Trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs. They use a tagging mechanism to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to. This allows switches to route traffic to the correct VLANs.

*VLANs are logically isolated networks within a physical network. VLANs are configured on switches on a per-interface basis.

*VLANs logically separate end hosts at Layer 2. Although the hosts in the above sample topology are physically connected to the same switch, and therefore in the same broadcast domain, we used VLANs to logically separate them, and put them in separate broadcast domains.

*VLANs help improve network performance and network security. VLANs help to reduce unnecessary broadcast traffic, which helps prevent network congestion and therefore improve network performance. Limiting broadcast and unknown unicast messages also improves network security, since these messages will not be received by devices outside of the VLAN.

## Configuring access ports on Cisco switches

Let’s begin by looking at basic VLAN configuration.

![basic-vlan-diagram](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cc4c0-basic-vlan-diagram-6.webp?w=1201)


First let’s look at the VLANs that exist by default on a switch. 

In this CLI output we used the **show vlan brief** command. The output displays the VLANs that exist on the switch, and which interfaces are in each VLAN.

![show-vlan-brief-cli](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/9836b-show-vlan-brief-cli-7.webp?w=1201)


VLAN1 has the name “default.” **This is the VLAN that all interfaces are assigned to by default.** Even if we do not configure any VLANs, all interfaces are in VLAN1 by default.

Under VLAN1 are four other VLANs, 1002 to 1005, used for FDDI and token ring. These are old technologies that you do not need to know for the CCNA. **VLANS 1 and 1002-1005 exist by default and cannot be deleted**.

Under the Ports column you can see all the interfaces on this device, from G0/0 to G3/3.

#### How to assign interfaces to a VLAN

Use the **interface range** command to configure all the VLAN 10 interfaces at once.

Use the **switchport mode access** command to set the interface as an access port.

![assign-interfaces-VLAN](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7ff75-assign-interfaces-vlan-8.webp)



A switchport connected to an end host should enter access mode by default. However, it’s always a good idea to explicitly configure the setting and not rely on autonegotiation of port type.

Next, use the command **switchport access vlan**, followed by the VLAN number, to assign the VLAN to the port. 

We used switchport access vlan 10. Notice the message that appears after entering this command, “% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 10”.

Because VLAN10 did not exist on the device yet, it was created automatically when we assigned the interface to VLAN10. If we assign a switch interface to a VLAN that does not exist, the switch will create the VLAN.

We will see how to manually create a VLAN in a minute.

Next, again we use the interface range command to configure all of the VLAN 20 interfaces at once. We use the same switchport mode access command, then switchport access vlan 20 to assign the interfaces to VLAN 20. We then configure VLAN30 using the same commands, in the same way. 

Using the **show vlan brief** command again, we can see the three VLANs we created, and the ports we assigned to each VLAN.

![show-vlan-brief-default-vlans](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/566d0-show-vlan-brief-default-vlans-9.webp?w=1201)



Notice the default names of each VLAN – let’s change those to make them more understandable.

Use the vlan 10 command to enter configuration mode for VLAN 10.

```
SW1(config)#  vlan 10
```

This is also the command to create a VLAN. But in this case, it was already automatically created when we assigned the interfaces to the VLAN.

Next, we assign the VLAN name with the command name ENGINEERING.

```
SW1(config-vlan)#  name ENGINEERING
```

Then we do the same for VLAN 20 (HR) and VLAN 30 (sales). 

Finally, we confirm the configurations with **show vlan brief**. You will notice that the names have been changed to ENGINEERING, HR, and SALES.

**Remember:**

*By default, before configuring VLANs, each router interface and everything connected to it are in one broadcast domain. If no VLANs have been configured, all hosts/interfaces are in the same default VLAN, VLAN1.

*VLANs logically separate hosts and put them in separate broadcast domains. Each configured VLAN constitutes a broadcast domain (the connection between two routers is also a broadcast domain).
