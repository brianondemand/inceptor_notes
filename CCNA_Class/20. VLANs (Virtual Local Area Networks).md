### What is a LAN

A local area network (LAN) is a group of devices (servers, routers, switches, etc.) in a small geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.

LANs can be wired or wireless. Wired LANs usually use Ethernet cables and switches, while wireless LANs use Wi-Fi routers and access points. Some LANs can use both wired and wireless connections for different devices or purposes.

LANs can be connected to other LANs or wide area networks (WANs) via routers or gateways to form larger networks that span multiple locations or regions.

A LAN is a single broadcast domain, including all devices in that broadcast domain.

## Broadcast domains

A broadcast domain is a group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame (having a destination MAC of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by one of the devices in the domain.

![][https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/f0fb5-broadcast-domains.webp]

PC6, PC7, PC8, SW3, and one of R2’s interfaces constitute one broadcast domain (the blue compartment). If PC6 sends a broadcast frame, SW3 will receive it and flood it to PC7, PC8, and R2. (R2 will not forward the frame. A router will receive a broadcast frame but will not forward it to other networks.)

There are three more broadcast domains, the yellow compartment, the green compartment, and the connection between R1 and R2. If R1 sends a broadcast frame out of its interface which is connected to R2, the frame will be received only by R2.

A switch will never forward traffic directly between two VLANs.

A switch will not forward frames between VLANs directly, it must send the frames to a router first.

## What is a VLAN

A **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)** is a way to logically separate devices on a network without requiring physical separation. It allows you to group computers, servers, and other devices into different networks even if they are connected to the same physical switch.

VLAN1 comes as the default VLAN in may cisco switches. You can add up to 4094 VLANs

**Why Use VLANs?**

- **Improves Security**: Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly unless explicitly allowed.
- **Better Network Management**: Reduces network congestion by limiting broadcast traffic to specific VLANs.
- **Flexibility**: Devices can be placed in the same VLAN regardless of their physical location.

**Example of a VLAN**

Imagine a company has different departments: **Sales, Engineering, and HR**. Without VLANs, all devices in these departments would be on the same network, meaning:
- Sales computers could communicate directly with HR and Engineering, which may not be ideal for security.
- Broadcast traffic from one department could slow down the entire network.

**With VLANs:**

1. The network admin creates three VLANs:
   - VLAN 10 for **Engineering**
   - VLAN 20 for **HR**
   - VLAN 30 for **Sales**
   
2. Even though all departments are connected to the same physical switch, VLANs keep their network traffic separate.
   
3. If a Sales computer (VLAN 30) wants to communicate with an HR computer (VLAN 20), a router or a Layer 3 switch must handle the communication.

This setup ensures security, reduces congestion, and makes network management easier.

## Explanation of VLAN Communication   


### Communication Within the Same VLAN

- Devices **within the same VLAN** can communicate **directly** because they share the same subnet.
  
	**Example:**  
  
  - **PC1** (VLAN 10) can communicate with another PC in VLAN 10 without any router.
  - **PC2** (VLAN 30) can communicate with other PCs in VLAN 30 without a router.

### Communication Between Different VLANs

- **VLANs cannot communicate with each other directly** because they are separate broadcast domains.
  
- When a device from **VLAN 10** (Engineering) wants to communicate with a device from **VLAN 30** (Sales), the traffic must go through **Router R1**.
  
- The router is performing **Inter-VLAN Routing**, allowing communication between VLANs.

### How Inter-VLAN Communication Works

- When **PC1 (VLAN 10, 192.168.1.0/26)** wants to send data to **PC2 (VLAN 30, 192.168.1.128/26)**:
  
  1. PC1 sends the packet to its **default gateway** (Router R1).
 
  2. The router **receives the packet**, checks the destination subnet, and routes it to VLAN 30.
 
  3. The packet is sent to PC2 in VLAN 30, completing the communication.

**Summary**

- **Same VLAN → Direct communication**  
- **Different VLANs → Routed through R1**  
- **Router enables inter-VLAN communication**

### Types of VLANs
   
   
   - **Default VLAN**: Usually VLAN 1, where all ports belong by default.  
     
   - **Data VLAN**: Used for user-generated traffic (e.g., Engineering, Sales VLANs).  
     
   - **Voice VLAN**: Optimized for VoIP traffic.  
     
   - **Management VLAN**: Used for network management (e.g., switch configuration).  
     
   - **Native VLAN**: Used for untagged traffic on trunk ports.  

### Port Types

#### Access Port: 

An **access port** is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts such as computers, printers, and servers. It is called an access port because it gives the end hosts access to the network.

#### Trunk Port: 

Trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs. They use a tagging mechanism to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to. This allows switches to route traffic to the correct VLANs.

*VLANs are logically isolated networks within a physical network. VLANs are configured on switches on a per-interface basis.

*VLANs logically separate end hosts at Layer 2. Although the hosts in the above sample topology are physically connected to the same switch, and therefore in the same broadcast domain, we used VLANs to logically separate them, and put them in separate broadcast domains.

*VLANs help improve network performance and network security. VLANs help to reduce unnecessary broadcast traffic, which helps prevent network congestion and therefore improve network performance. Limiting broadcast and unknown unicast messages also improves network security, since these messages will not be received by devices outside of the VLAN.

## Configuring access ports on Cisco switches

Let’s begin by looking at basic VLAN configuration.

![basic-vlan-diagram](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cc4c0-basic-vlan-diagram-6.webp?w=1201)


First let’s look at the VLANs that exist by default on a switch. 

In this CLI output we used the **show vlan brief** command. The output displays the VLANs that exist on the switch, and which interfaces are in each VLAN.

![show-vlan-brief-cli](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/9836b-show-vlan-brief-cli-7.webp?w=1201)


VLAN1 has the name “default.” **This is the VLAN that all interfaces are assigned to by default.** Even if we do not configure any VLANs, all interfaces are in VLAN1 by default.

Under VLAN1 are four other VLANs, 1002 to 1005, used for FDDI and token ring. These are old technologies that you do not need to know for the CCNA. **VLANS 1 and 1002-1005 exist by default and cannot be deleted**.

Under the Ports column you can see all the interfaces on this device, from G0/0 to G3/3.

#### How to assign interfaces to a VLAN

Use the **interface range** command to configure all the VLAN 10 interfaces at once.

Use the **switchport mode access** command to set the interface as an access port.

![assign-interfaces-VLAN](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7ff75-assign-interfaces-vlan-8.webp)



A switchport connected to an end host should enter access mode by default. However, it’s always a good idea to explicitly configure the setting and not rely on autonegotiation of port type.

Next, use the command **switchport access vlan**, followed by the VLAN number, to assign the VLAN to the port. 

We used switchport access vlan 10. Notice the message that appears after entering this command, “% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 10”.

Because VLAN10 did not exist on the device yet, it was created automatically when we assigned the interface to VLAN10. If we assign a switch interface to a VLAN that does not exist, the switch will create the VLAN.

We will see how to manually create a VLAN in a minute.

Next, again we use the interface range command to configure all of the VLAN 20 interfaces at once. We use the same switchport mode access command, then switchport access vlan 20 to assign the interfaces to VLAN 20. We then configure VLAN30 using the same commands, in the same way. 

Using the **show vlan brief** command again, we can see the three VLANs we created, and the ports we assigned to each VLAN.

![show-vlan-brief-default-vlans](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/566d0-show-vlan-brief-default-vlans-9.webp?w=1201)



Notice the default names of each VLAN – let’s change those to make them more understandable.

Use the vlan 10 command to enter configuration mode for VLAN 10.

```
SW1(config)#  vlan 10
```

This is also the command to create a VLAN. But in this case, it was already automatically created when we assigned the interfaces to the VLAN.

Next, we assign the VLAN name with the command name ENGINEERING.

```
SW1(config-vlan)#  name ENGINEERING
```

Then we do the same for VLAN 20 (HR) and VLAN 30 (sales). 

Finally, we confirm the configurations with **show vlan brief**. You will notice that the names have been changed to ENGINEERING, HR, and SALES.

**Remember:**

*By default, before configuring VLANs, each router interface and everything connected to it are in one broadcast domain. If no VLANs have been configured, all hosts/interfaces are in the same default VLAN, VLAN1.

*VLANs logically separate hosts and put them in separate broadcast domains. Each configured VLAN constitutes a broadcast domain (the connection between two routers is also a broadcast domain).

#### Command review

```
SW#  show vlan brief
``` 

→ to display the VLANs that exist on the switch and which interfaces are in each VLAN

```
SW(config)#  interface _interface-name interface-number_  
```

→ to configure one VLAN interface (to enter interface configuration mode)

```
SW(config)#  interface range _interface-range_ 
```
 
→ to configure a range of VLAN interfaces at once

```
SW(config-if-range)#  switchport mode access
```
  
→ to set the interface as an access port

```
SW(config-if-range)#  switchport access vlan _vlan-number_
```  

→ to assign the VLAN to the port, and to create the VLAN if assigning an interface to a VLAN that does not exist

```
SW(config)#  vlan _vlan-number_ 
```
 
→ to create a vlan (and enter vlan config mode)

```
SW(config-vlan)#  name _name_  
```

→ to assign a name to the VLAN

### Inter-VLAN Routing

Inter-VLAN routing is a process that allows communication between different VLANs  within a network. Without inter-VLAN routing, devices in one VLAN cannot communicate with devices in another VLAN. This routing can be achieved using a Layer 3 switch or a router.

For example, imagine you have two VLANs:

- VLAN 10 for the HR department
- VLAN 20 for the Sales department

If a computer in VLAN 10 wants to communicate with a computer in VLAN 20, the traffic must go through a router or Layer 3 switch. The router examines the destination IP address of the packet, determines which VLAN the destination device belongs to, and then forwards the packet accordingly.

**Example setup for inter-VLAN routing:**

- Switch 1 has VLAN 10 and VLAN 20.
  
- A router is connected to the switch via a trunk link (carries multiple VLANs) and has sub-interfaces for each VLAN (VLAN 10 and VLAN 20).
  
- If a device in VLAN 10 sends a message to a device in VLAN 20, the router will route the traffic between the two VLANs.

### Access Ports

Access ports are switch ports that are configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN. These ports are typically used to connect end devices like computers, printers, or servers to the network. When a device is connected to an access port, it is automatically assigned to the VLAN configured on that port, and the traffic sent and received on that port is untagged, meaning it does not include any 
VLAN identification information.

For instance, if a computer is part of VLAN 10, the switch port to which the computer is connected would be set to access mode and assigned to VLAN 10. When the computer sends traffic, it will only be part of VLAN 10, and the switch will not tag that traffic with any VLAN identifier since the port is dedicated to one VLAN.

**Example setup for an access port:**

- Port 1 on Switch 1 is configured as an access port for VLAN 10.
  
- The computer connected to Port 1 will send and receive traffic tagged as VLAN 10, and the switch will keep it in that VLAN until it reaches the router or Layer 3 device.


### Trunk Ports

Trunk ports are switch ports that carry traffic for multiple VLANs. Unlike access ports, which are dedicated to a single VLAN, trunk ports allow traffic from several VLANs to pass through them. This is particularly useful in networks where VLANs span multiple switches, as it allows for efficient use of network resources. Trunk ports use VLAN tagging to keep traffic from different VLANs separate as it travels over the same physical link.

When you configure a port as a trunk port, you allow it to pass tagged frames, where each frame includes a VLAN tag (using IEEE 802.1Q or other trunking protocols). A trunk port is essential for inter-switch communication in a VLAN-based network.

**Example setup for a trunk port:**

- Switch 1 has VLANs 10 and 20 configured.
- Switch 2 also has VLANs 10 and 20.
- The port connecting Switch 1 and Switch 2 is configured as a trunk port.
- Traffic from both VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 will be tagged appropriately when it travels over the trunk port from Switch 1 to Switch 2.

### VLAN Tagging

VLAN tagging is a method used to identify which VLAN a packet belongs to as it travels across a network. This is done by adding a VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame. The tag contains a VLAN ID, which is used by network devices to determine how to handle the packet. VLAN tagging is essential when traffic from multiple VLANs needs to travel over the same physical link, such as in the case of trunk ports.

The most common VLAN tagging protocol is **IEEE 802.1Q**. This standard inserts a 4-byte tag into the Ethernet frame, marking it with a VLAN ID. The tag includes the VLAN's ID (from 1 to 4095) to allow the switch or router to determine which VLAN the frame belongs to.

**Example setup for VLAN tagging:**

- Switch 1 is configured with VLANs 10 and 20.
- Traffic from a device in VLAN 10 is tagged with VLAN ID 10.
- Traffic from a device in VLAN 20 is tagged with VLAN ID 20.
- The trunk port between Switch 1 and Switch 2 uses 802.1Q tagging to preserve the VLAN information as the traffic moves between switches.


### Trunking Protocols

Trunking protocols are used to manage the communication between switches over trunk ports. These protocols ensure that VLAN information is correctly transmitted and received across the network. One of the most common trunking protocols is IEEE 802.1Q, which is an open standard used by many vendors. Another trunking protocol is Cisco's proprietary ISL (Inter-Switch Link), although it is less commonly used today.

- **IEEE 802.1Q** is the most widely used and open standard. It inserts a 4-byte tag into the Ethernet frame to identify the VLAN. The 802.1Q tag is inserted into the frame’s header and carries information like the VLAN ID.
    
- **ISL** (Inter-Switch Link) is a proprietary Cisco protocol. It encapsulates the entire Ethernet frame with an additional header to carry VLAN information. However, because 802.1Q is standardized, it is more commonly used in modern networks.
    

**Example of a trunking protocol (IEEE 802.1Q):**

- When Switch 1 sends traffic from VLAN 10 to Switch 2 over a trunk link, the frame is tagged with the 802.1Q tag to indicate it belongs to VLAN 10.
- Switch 2 then reads the VLAN tag to know that the frame should be forwarded to the devices in VLAN 10.


### IEEE 802.1Q Tag

The IEEE 802.1Q tag is a specific type of VLAN tag that is added to Ethernet frames to indicate VLAN membership. This tag is 4 bytes long and is inserted into the Ethernet frame between the source MAC address and the EtherType/Length fields. The tag includes a VLAN ID, which is a 12-bit field that can identify up to 4094 VLANs. The IEEE 802.1Q standard is widely used in modern networks for VLAN tagging.

The **IEEE 802.1Q** tag is a 4-byte header added to Ethernet frames. This tag allows network devices to differentiate between frames from different VLANs when they travel across trunk links. The 4 bytes include:

1. **TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier)**: 2 bytes that define the frame as a tagged frame.
2. **TCI (Tag Control Information)**: 2 bytes containing the VLAN ID and other information.

The **VLAN ID** is a 12-bit field within the TCI, allowing up to 4096 different VLANs, from VLAN 1 to VLAN 4095 (with some reserved ranges). This allows network devices to determine the specific VLAN a frame belongs to, ensuring that traffic is directed appropriately.

**Example of IEEE 802.1Q Tagging:**

- Frame from a device in VLAN 10 will have the 802.1Q tag inserted, which will carry the VLAN ID of 10.
- When the frame reaches another switch, the VLAN ID is used to ensure the frame is forwarded to the correct VLAN.

To demonstrate exactly how the VLAN Tag modifies a packet, take a look at the packet capture below of the same frame before and after it exits a Trunk port.

![vlan-dot1q-tag](https://www.practicalnetworking.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vlan-dot1q-tag-1024x237.png)

The portion of the frame highlighted in yellow is the added VLAN tag. Notice it is inserted between the *Source MAC address* and *Type* field of the original Ethernet header.


### VLAN Range

The VLAN range refers to the number of VLANs that can be created and managed within a network. The standard VLAN range is from 1 to 4094, with VLAN 1 being the default VLAN that is typically used for management purposes. Some VLANs within this range may be reserved for specific uses, and the exact range available for user-defined VLANs can vary depending on the network equipment and configuration.

The VLAN range refers to the total number of VLANs that can be defined in a network. The 802.1Q standard allows for a total of 4096 VLANs, with VLAN IDs ranging from 1 to 4095.

- **VLAN 1** is reserved by default for management and should generally not be used for user data traffic.
- VLANs **1002-1005** are reserved for legacy protocols, like Token Ring and FDDI, and are rarely used in modern networks.
- The range of usable VLANs is from 2 to 4094, with each VLAN providing a distinct broadcast domain.

**Example of VLAN Range:**

- VLAN 10 could be used for HR.
- VLAN 20 could be used for Sales.
- VLAN 30 could be used for IT. Each VLAN operates independently, and the router must route traffic between them when communication is required.

### Native VLAN

The native VLAN is the VLAN that is assigned to untagged traffic arriving on a trunk port. In other words, if a packet arrives on a trunk port without a VLAN tag, it is assumed to belong to the native VLAN. By default, the native VLAN is usually VLAN 1, but it can be changed to any other VLAN for security or organizational reasons. It is important to ensure that the native VLAN is consistent across all switches in a network to avoid potential issues.

By default, VLAN 1 is the native VLAN, but this can be changed for security reasons. It’s generally a best practice to avoid using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN, as it’s often targeted by attackers who try to exploit default configurations.

**Example of Native VLAN:**

- Switch 1 has a trunk port that carries traffic for VLANs 10, 20, and 30.
- The native VLAN is set to VLAN 99.
- Any untagged frames on the trunk link will be assigned to VLAN 99.

### Router on a Stick (ROAS)

Router on a Stick (ROAS) is a method of inter-VLAN routing that uses a single router interface to handle traffic for multiple VLANs. In this setup, the router is connected to a switch via a trunk port, and the router is configured with sub-interfaces, each corresponding to a different VLAN. The router then routes traffic between the VLANs by examining the VLAN tags on the incoming packets and forwarding them to the appropriate sub-interface. This method is often used in smaller networks where purchasing a Layer 3 switch is not feasible.

The router’s sub-interfaces are configured with IP addresses corresponding to the VLANs, and the router will route traffic between them as needed.

**Example setup for Router on a Stick:**

- Switch 1 has VLANs 10 and 20.
- A router is connected to Switch 1 via a trunk link, and the router has sub-interfaces for VLAN 10 (192.168.10.1) and VLAN 20 (192.168.20.1).
- Devices in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 can communicate by sending their traffic to the router, which will route the packets between the VLANs.

This configuration is called "Router on a Stick" because the single router interface is used to perform routing for multiple VLANs over a single trunk link.
