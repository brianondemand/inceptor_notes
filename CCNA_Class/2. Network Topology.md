**Network topology** is a physical arrangement through which various endpoints (devices) and links in an enterprise network communicate with each other.

The structure of a network can directly impact its functioning. Therefore, companies must select the most suitable topology for their network to bolster performance and enhance data efficiency. The right topology also optimizes resource allocation and minimizes operational costs.

Different types of network topologies exist, and businesses can choose the one that best suits their requirements by considering the size, budget, and goals of their organization.

# Types of Network Topology


Some common physical network topologies used by organizations include point to point, bus, ring, star, tree, mesh, and hybrid topology networks. Each type consists of different node and link configurations and has its own advantages and disadvantages.


### 1. Point to Point Topology

Point to point is a simple topology that directly links two nodes and reserves the entire bandwidth of the connection for them to communicate with one another. Physically, point-to-point connections rely on a cable or wire that connects the two endpoints.

| **Benefits of Point-to-Point Topology**                       | **Challenges of Point-to-Point Topology**                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Superior bandwidth, as only two nodes use the link            | Only applicable for small areas with nodes physically close to each other                |
| High speed when compared to other types of network topologies | High dependence on the common link; if the link fails, the network goes down             |
| Simple to implement                                           | Only useful if the network has two nodes; thus, not applicable for many modern use cases |
| Easy to maintain and handle                                   |                                                                                          |
| Low instances of latency                                      |                                                                                          |

### 2. Bus topology

In a bus topology, all the nodes are linked using a single cable with a terminator on both ends. This configuration sees one main cable acting as the backbone for the whole network.

![][https://zd-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/10110911/16.png]

In such an arrangement, the server node transmits data from one end of the cable and in a single direction to the client node. As the data travels to each node, its destination address (MAC/IP) is checked to see if it is received and processed. If there is a mismatch in the address, the node does not do anything with the data.

| **Benefits of Bus Topology**                                                                                                               | **Challenges of Bus Topology**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy to add new devices and replace or remove existing devices without affecting other devices connected to the network                    | Device failure and other network faults are difficult to locate in the network                         |
| Failure in a few devices does not affect other devices or the network                                                                      | Damage to the backbone cable can bring the entire network to a halt                                    |
| Less cable is required when compared to other network topologies such as mesh and star; the cable can be extended easily whenever required | Increase in the bandwidth consumption of a few devices can affect the performance of the whole network |

### 3. Ring topology

In a ring topology, each node is linked with its neighbour to form a closed network. This configuration sees the data move from one node to another, either unidirectionally or bidirectionally. Such network topology is used in smaller networks, like those in schools.

|**Benefits of Ring Topology**|**Challenges of Ring Topology**|
|---|---|
|Circular flow of data minimizes packet collision|A single failure in the cable can disrupt overall network operations|
|Unidirectional ring topologies feature high-speed data transmission|Unidirectional ring networks see data packets pass through numerous nodes before reaching their destination|
|Robust system – can handle a high number of nodes and heavy traffic|Adding, modifying, or removing nodes is difficult and can disrupt network activity|
|Lower chances of data loss over long distances||
|Faults are located more easily, making troubleshooting efficient||

### 4. Star topology

In a star topology, all nodes are connected to a central hub using a communication link. Each node needs a separate wire to establish a point-to-point connection with the hub, which functions as a server to control and manage the entire network.

| **Benefits of Star Topology**                                             | **Challenges of Star Topology**                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy network maintenance and management since each node has its own cable | Choosing the right central hub is vital, as this device needs to be compatible with all nodes and links in the network |
| Failures affect only one device, and problem areas are located swiftly    | Higher requirement of cables and connectors                                                                            |
| Adding new devices is simple and straightforward                          | Failure of the central hub brings down the entire network                                                              |
| Rapid data transfer                                                       |                                                                                                                        |

### 5. Tree topology

In a tree topology, nodes are arranged in a configuration that resembles a tree’s leaves, branches, and trunk. Endpoints, or ‘leaves,’ are connected to mid-level nodes or ‘branches’ linked to the tree’s ‘trunk.’ The trunk is the backbone connection that links multiple mid-level nodes.

![][https://zd-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/10110848/19.png]

Tree topologies are suitable for large networks such as offices, university campuses, and hospitals.

|**Benefits of Tree Topology**|**Challenges of Tree Topology**|
|---|---|
|Ideal for nodes that are grouped together|Large volume of cabling and numerous hubs are required|
|Superior scalability; more nodes and hierarchies can be added without disrupting the existing network|Difficult to configure and maintain|
|In case of damage to one part of the network, other nodes and hierarchies remain unaffected|Failure of the central backbone (trunk) brings the entire network down|
|Swift and easy fault identification and maintenance||
|High-speed data transfer among nodes in one hierarchy||

### 6. Mesh topology

In a mesh topology, all the nodes are interconnected and can send and receive their data and relay data from other nodes.

![][https://zd-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/10110856/20.png]


|**Benefits of Mesh Topology**|**Challenges of Mesh Topology**|
|---|---|
|Extremely robust and redundant, as any node or link failure affects a minimum number of endpoints|Requires many cables and input/output (I/O) ports|
|Highly efficient data transfer due to dedicated point-to-point links for all devices|Time-consuming installation and maintenance|
|Robust security and privacy|Cost-intensive|
|Swift fault identification||

### 7. Hybrid topology

A hybrid network topology, as the name suggests, features characteristics of multiple other topologies. The creation of such a configuration depends on the requirement of the network.

![][https://zd-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/10110834/21-3.png]


Two most commonly used hybrid topologies are star-ring and star-bus. In the former, the central hubs of multiple star topologies are linked using a ring topology. In the latter, the hubs of numerous star topologies are connected using a bus topology.

|**Benefits of Hybrid Topology**|**Challenges of Hybrid Topology**|
|---|---|
|Combines the advantages of multiple topologies|Depending on the configuration, such a network can be resource-intensive to create and maintain|
|Can be tailor-made to suit specific network requirements|Potentially complicated design that could make troubleshooting difficult|
|Highly flexible and scalable if implemented correctly|Requires compatible cabling and other hardware for inter-topology links|

### 8. Daisy chain topology

Finally, the daisy chain topology links nodes in a sequence. Data is transferred from one node to the next until it reaches its destination. The two types of a daisy chain network topology are linear daisy chain and ring daisy chain.

|**Benefits of Daisy Chain Topology**|**Challenges of Daisy Chain Topology**|
|---|---|
|Simple to create and maintain|Slow data transmission, especially in networks with numerous nodes|
|Minimal cable usage|Easy failure, particularly in linear daisy chain topologies|
|Cost-savings|All nodes require two transmitters and two receivers for successful data transmission|
