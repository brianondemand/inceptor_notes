IP addressing is the process of assigning a unique numerical label to a device that uses the internet.

 An IP address definition is a numeric label assigned to devices that use the internet to communicate. 
 
 Computers that communicate over the internet or via local networks share information to a specific location using IP addresses.

IP addresses have two distinct versions or standards.

The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address is the older of the two, which has space for up to 4 billion IP addresses and is assigned to all computers. 

The more recent Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) has space for trillions of IP addresses, which accounts for the new breed of devices in addition to computers. 

### How does an IP address work?

Common tasks for an IP address include both the identification of a host or a network, or identifying the location of a device. 

An IP address is not random. The creation of an IP address has the basis of math.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates the IP address and its creation. The full range of IP addresses can go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.  

With the mathematical assignment of an IP address, the unique identification to make a connection to a destination can be made.



There are also several types of IP addresses, including public, private, static, and dynamic IP addresses.



- A **public IP address**, or external-facing IP address, applies to the main device people use to connect their business or home internet network to their internet service provider (ISP). In most cases, this will be the router. All devices that connect to a router communicate with other IP addresses using the router’s IP address.


- A **private IP address**, is assigned by an office or local area network to devices, or by the internet service provider (ISP). The home/office router manages the private IP addresses to the devices that connect to it from within that local network.

- A **static IP address** is a manually configured signifier assigned to a device that remains consistent and cannot change across multiple network sessions.

- A **dynamic IP address** is automatically assigned to a network when a router is set up. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) assigns the distribution of this dynamic set of IP addresses. The DHCP can be the router that provides IP addresses to networks across a home or an organization.

## What Is IPv4?

IPv4 is the fourth version of the IP. IPv4 is currently assigned to all computers. An IPv4 address uses 32-bit binary numbers to form a unique IP address. 

It takes the format of four sets of numbers, each of which ranges from 0 to 255 and represents an eight-digit binary number, separated by a period point.

### Structure of an IPv4 Address

- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number divided into four 8-bit octets.
- It is written in **dotted decimal notation**, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.

### IP Address Classes

Some IP addresses are reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These are typically reserved for networks that carry a specific purpose on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which is used to interconnect devices. Four of these IP address classes include:

- **0.0.0.0**: This IP address in IPv4 is also known as the default network. It is the non-routeable meta address that designates an invalid, non-applicable, or unknown network target.

- **127.0.0.1**: This IP address is known as the loopback address, which a computer uses to identify itself regardless of whether it has been assigned an IP address.

- **169.254.0.1** to **169.254.254.254**: A range of addresses that are automatically assigned if a computer is unsuccessful in an attempt to receive an address from the DHCP.

- **255.255.255.255**: An address dedicated to messages that need to be sent to every computer on a network or broadcasted across a network.


Further reserved IP addresses are for what is known as subnet classes. Subnetworks are small computer networks that connect to a bigger network via a router. 

The subnet can be assigned its own IP address system, so that all devices connecting to it can communicate with each other without having to send data via the wider network.

 IP addresses are reserved for the following subnets:

1. **Class A**: IP addresses between **10.0.0.0** and **10.255.255.255**
2. **Class B**: IP addresses between **172.16.0.0** and **172.31.255.255**
3. **Class C**: IP addresses between **192.186.0.0** and **192.168.255.255**
4. **Class D or multicast**: IP addresses between **224.0.0.0** and **239.255.255.255**
5. **Class E, which are reserved for experimental usage**: IP addresses between **240.0.0.0** and **254.255.255.254**

IP addresses listed under Class A, Class B, and Class C are most commonly used in the creation of subnets.

Class D reserved for multicast addressing (group communication, e.g., video streaming). 

Class E reserved for research and experimental purposes.

|**Class**|**First Octet Range**|**Default Subnet Mask**|**Purpose**|**Key Note**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|0 - 127|255.0.0.0|Large networks|First bit is `0`|
|B|128 - 191|255.255.0.0|Medium networks|First two bits are `10`|
|C|192 - 223|255.255.255.0|Small networks|First three bits are `110`|
|D|224 - 239|N/A|Multicasting|First four bits are `1110`|
|E|240 - 255|N/A|Experimental/Research|First four bits are `1111`|

### MAC address

The manufacturer of a network card or router is the provider of the MAC address.

- A MAC address is a 6-byte hexadecimal address while an IP address is a 4 or 16-byte address.
- A MAC address is in a data link layer, while an IP address is in a network layer.
- A third party will have a difficult time finding a MAC address, while it can easily find an IP address.
- MAC addresses are static, while IP addresses can change dynamically 
- MAC addresses and IP addresses are necessary to get a network packet to a destination.  However, no one can see your MAC address unless they are on your LAN
