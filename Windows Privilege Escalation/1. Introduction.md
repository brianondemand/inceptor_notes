**Windows Privilege Escalation** is the process of gaining **higher-level access or permissions** on a Windows system than originally granted ‚Äî typically moving from a **low-privileged user account** to **SYSTEM** or **Administrator** level.

### üîë Why is it Important?

Privilege escalation is a **critical step in hacking or penetration testing**, because it allows an attacker to:

- Bypass restrictions

- Steal sensitive data

- Install rootkits/backdoors

- Maintain persistence

- Perform lateral movement across networks


---

### üß≠ Two Main Types:

#### 1. **Vertical Privilege Escalation**

- **Definition**: Gaining _higher_ privileges than allowed (e.g., user ‚ûù admin).

- **Example**: Exploiting a service running as SYSTEM to gain SYSTEM-level access.


#### 2. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**

- **Definition**: Gaining access to resources of _another user_ with the same privilege level.

- **Example**: Accessing another user's files or sessions.

### üîç Common Techniques

Here are some popular techniques used in **Windows privilege escalation**:

|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|üîß **Unquoted Service Paths**|Misconfigured service paths with spaces can be hijacked.|
|üõ† **Weak Service Permissions**|Modify or replace a service binary due to weak ACLs.|
|üìÅ **DLL Hijacking**|Placing malicious DLLs where Windows loads them first.|
|üõ° **Token Impersonation**|Stealing or impersonating tokens from higher-privileged processes.|
|üíæ **AlwaysInstallElevated**|Misconfigured registry keys allow MSI installs as SYSTEM.|
|üß© **UAC Bypass**|Exploiting ways to bypass User Account Control.|
|üîå **Insecure Registry Permissions**|Overwrite registry keys that control privileged programs.|
|üß† **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**|Exploiting known Windows or third-party software vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-1732).|

### üß† What is the Windows Kernel?

The **Windows Kernel** is the **core part of the Windows operating system**. It acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**, managing everything from memory to processes, input/output, and device drivers.

Think of it as the **‚Äúbrainstem‚Äù** of Windows: everything depends on it, but you usually don‚Äôt interact with it directly.

Microsoft keeps the **Windows kernel** and most of its core components **closed-source and proprietary**. That means:

- You **can‚Äôt freely view or modify** the kernel source code.

- You **can‚Äôt legally redistribute or reverse engineer** it (without permission).


Even though it‚Äôs closed-source:

- Microsoft provides **documentation**: [Windows Internals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/) + [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/)

- Books like **Windows Internals** by Mark Russinovich go deep into it.

- Tools like **WinDbg**, **Process Monitor**, and **Sysinternals** help observe how the kernel behaves at runtime.

---

### üß© Main Roles of the Kernel:

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|üß† **Process Management**|Starts, stops, and schedules applications.|
|üì¶ **Memory Management**|Controls RAM allocation, virtual memory, and memory protection.|
|üß± **Hardware Abstraction**|Talks to hardware via drivers so apps don't have to.|
|üîê **Security & Access Control**|Enforces privileges, permissions, and user isolation.|
|üì° **System Calls Handling**|Apps request kernel services through APIs like `NtCreateFile`, `NtQuerySystemInformation`, etc.|

---

### üèó Components of the Windows Kernel

1. **Executive (NTOSKRNL.EXE)**  
    The main kernel image. Handles:
    
    - Process/thread management
    
    - I/O operations
    
    - Security
    
    - Memory

2. **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**  
    Lets Windows work across different hardware platforms by hiding hardware details.

3. **Kernel Mode Drivers**  
    Code that runs in kernel mode for interacting with hardware.

4. **Microkernel Layer**  
    Handles low-level tasks like thread scheduling, interrupts, and synchronization.
    

---

### üõ° Kernel Modes

Windows has two execution levels:

|Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|**User Mode**|Where normal applications run. Limited access to system resources.|
|**Kernel Mode**|Where the OS core and drivers run. Has full access to hardware.|

A crash in **user mode** affects only that app.  
A crash in **kernel mode** causes the **blue screen of death (BSOD)**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Hackers Care About the Kernel

Because:

- **Running code in the kernel = total control** over the system.

- Kernel exploits can **bypass all security**, including antivirus and Windows Defender.

- Kernel vulnerabilities (like **CVE-2021-1732**) can allow **privilege escalation** to SYSTEM.

### History of Microsoft Windows

**1. Windows 1.0 (1985)**  

This was Microsoft's first attempt at a graphical user interface (GUI) on top of MS-DOS. It featured basic programs like Paint, Notepad, and a simple task switcher. It was very limited and relied heavily on DOS underneath.

**2. Windows 3.0 / 3.1 (1990-1992)**  

These versions introduced improved graphics, better memory management, and a more user-friendly interface. Windows 3.1 became very popular in businesses and homes. It also introduced early multimedia support and TrueType fonts.

**3. Windows 95 (1995)**  

A major leap forward. It introduced the Start Menu, taskbar, plug and play hardware support, and could run 32-bit applications. Windows 95 merged DOS and Windows more tightly, making it feel like a standalone OS.

**4. Windows 98 / ME (1998-2000)**  

Improved support for hardware like USB, added Internet Explorer integration, and included the System Restore feature. Windows ME (Millennium Edition) was buggy and poorly received.

**5. Windows NT Line (1993‚Äìpresent)**  

Running in parallel with the home editions was Windows NT (New Technology) ‚Äî built for stability, security, and multitasking. NT 3.1, 4.0, then Windows 2000 became the foundation for modern Windows. The NT kernel replaced the older DOS-based system.

**6. Windows XP (2001)**  

A unification of the home and business lines. XP was fast, stable, and extremely popular. It featured a new look, better networking, remote desktop, and improved security (especially after Service Pack 2).

**7. Windows Vista (2006)**  

A complete redesign with the Aero Glass theme and improved security features like User Account Control (UAC). However, it was criticized for being heavy and slow on older machines.

**8. Windows 7 (2009)**  

Vista done right. Faster, more stable, and better looking. Windows 7 became a favorite, especially for businesses, and remained widely used even after newer versions were released.

**9. Windows 8 / 8.1 (2012-2013)**  

Introduced the controversial Start Screen, designed for touch devices. Removed the classic Start Menu, which confused many desktop users. Windows 8.1 tried to fix some of this backlash but never gained much love.

**10. Windows 10 (2015)**  

Brought back the Start Menu and focused on being a ‚Äúservice‚Äù with regular feature updates instead of new versions. Included Cortana, virtual desktops, and support for modern apps and devices. It was designed to be a long-term platform.

**11. Windows 11 (2021)**  

A modern refresh with a centered Start Menu, rounded corners, and tighter integration with cloud services and Microsoft Teams. Required newer hardware (like TPM 2.0) and introduced better support for hybrid CPUs, gaming (DirectStorage), and security.

## Windows Shells

A **shell** is the part of an operating system that allows users to interact with the system. In Windows, it can be **graphical (GUI)** or **command-line (CLI)**. It's what you use to **run programs, manage files, and give commands**.

## Command Prompt (CMD)

CMD (cmd.exe) is the **original command-line interpreter** for Windows. It comes from the **MS-DOS era** and is still available in all modern Windows versions.

**Key Features:**

- Basic command execution

- File/folder operations

- Batch scripting (`.bat` files)

- Lightweight and fast

- Very limited programming logic


**1. Basic CMD Commands**

These help you navigate and manage files/directories.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`dir`|List files and folders in current directory|
|`cd`|Change directory (`cd Desktop`)|
|`md` or `mkdir`|Create new folder (`mkdir test`)|
|`del`|Delete file (`del file.txt`)|
|`copy`|Copy file (`copy file.txt D:\Backup\`)|
|`move`|Move file or folder|
|`type`|Display contents of a file|
|`cls`|Clear the screen|
|`echo`|Display a message or text|
|`exit`|Close CMD|

**2. Permissions & User Commands**

Used to manage access, files, and user accounts.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`whoami`|Shows current logged-in user|
|`net user`|Lists local users (`net user`) or add users|
|`net user [username] [password] /add`|Create a new user|
|`net localgroup administrators [user] /add`|Add user to Administrators group|
|`cacls`|View or modify file/folder permissions (deprecated)|
|`icacls`|**Modern tool** to set/view NTFS permissions|
|`icacls folder /grant John:F`|Grant full access to user "John"|
|`runas /user:Administrator cmd`|Run CMD as another user|
|`attrib`|Change file attributes (e.g., hidden, read-only)|

**3. Networking Commands**

Used to troubleshoot or test network connections.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`ipconfig`|View IP address and network settings|
|`ipconfig /all`|Detailed network info|
|`ping [host]`|Test if a host is reachable (`ping google.com`)|
|`tracert [host]`|Trace route to host, shows hops|
|`nslookup [host]`|Query DNS info|
|`netstat -ano`|View open connections and listening ports|
|`netsh`|Configure network settings (powerful tool)|
|`net use`|Map or disconnect network drives|
|`net share`|View or create shared folders|
|`arp -a`|View ARP cache (local IP to MAC mappings)|
|`tasklist`|View running processes (can help find suspicious network usage)|

**`set` Command**

The `set` command is used to **create, modify, or display environment variables** in the Windows Command Prompt.

Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs or scripts ‚Äî like paths, user details, system info, etc.

- Creates an environment variable called `MYNAME` with the value `Brian`.

```powershell
set MYNAME=Brian
```

```powershell
echo %MYNAME%
```


**%PATH% ‚Äî The Execution Path Variable**

`%PATH%` stores a list of **directories** where Windows looks for executable files when you run a command in CMD or Run dialog.

Instead of typing the full path to a program, you can just type its name ‚Äî if it‚Äôs in `%PATH%`.

```powershell
echo %PATH%
```


- Windows is not case sensitive to file pathnames

**`where` Command**
The `where` command is used to **locate the full path** of executable files (or any file that matches a given name) in the **directories listed in `%PATH%`** or any specified location.

It's like the Linux `which` or `find` command.

```powershell
where notepad
```

```powershell
where whoami
```


Adding `/?` to any built-in or external command shows **its syntax and options**.


```powershell
xcopy /?
```
