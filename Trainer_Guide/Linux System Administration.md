## Linux System Administration


### Course Overview

**Linux System Administration** is designed for beginners and aspiring IT professionals who want to gain a deep understanding of the Linux operating system — from installation to system management, networking, and automation. This hands-on course focuses on practical skills and real-world tasks, preparing you for careers in system administration, DevOps, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.


#### Course Duration: 1 Months


###  Course Outline

**1. Installing the Linux Operating System**

Learn how to download, set up, and install Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Kali. This includes preparing bootable media, dual-boot installation, and setting up virtual machines.

**2. Using Essential Tools**

Gain hands-on experience with the Linux shell and terminal commands. You will become comfortable navigating directories, managing files, and executing essential system tasks using command-line tools.

**3. Essential File Management Tools**

Master working with the Linux file system. Learn how to list, copy, move, rename, delete, and search for files. Understand the structure and hierarchy of Linux file systems and mount points.

**4. Working with Text Files**

Explore tools like `cat`, `nano`, `vim`, `grep`, `less`, and `awk`. Learn how to view, edit, and search through text files — skills vital for log analysis, scripting, and configuration tasks.

**5. Connecting to a Linux Environment**

Understand local and remote access. Learn about terminal types, how to use TTY, SSH, and virtual consoles. You'll also configure secure remote access using SSH keys and understand terminal multiplexers like `tmux`.

**6. User and Group Management**

Discover how Linux handles users and groups. Create, modify, and delete users. Manage user permissions, group memberships, and understand configuration files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

**7. Configuring Permissions**

Learn about Linux permissions — read, write, execute — and how they affect files, directories, and users. Explore advanced features like special permissions (`SUID`, `SGID`, `Sticky Bit`) and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**8. Configuring Networking**

Develop a strong understanding of IP configuration, DNS, routing, and network troubleshooting commands (`ping`, `netstat`, `ss`, `ip`, `nmcli`, etc.). Learn how to edit network configuration files and use `NetworkManager`.

**9. Managing Processes**

Discover how to view, monitor, and control processes using commands like `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`, `nice`, and `renice`. Learn to troubleshoot stuck or high-resource processes and understand Linux process states.

**10. Managing Software**

Learn to install, update, and remove software using package managers like `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, and `snap`. Understand package repositories, PPAs, and offline installation methods.

**11. Scheduling Tasks**

Automate tasks using `cron` and `at`. Learn how to write crontab entries, manage scheduled tasks, and use systemd timers to automate system maintenance and monitoring jobs.

**12. Managing Partitions and Storage**

Explore how to manage storage using `fdisk`, `parted`, `lsblk`, and `mount`. Learn how to format disks, create partitions, and understand how Linux handles mounting and file systems (`ext4`, `xfs`, `btrfs`).
