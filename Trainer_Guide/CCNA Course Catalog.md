## **Part 1: Network Fundamentals** 
 
1. **Introduction to the CCNA**  
   - Overview of the CCNA certification and what to expect in networking fundamentals.  

2. **Network Devices**  
   - Explanation of routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and other network devices.  

3. **Cables, Connectors, and Ports**  
   - Types of cables (Ethernet, fiber, coaxial), connectors (RJ45, LC, SC), and ports used in networking.  

4. **The TCP/IP Networking Model**  
   - The OSI and TCP/IP models, their layers, and how data moves across networks.  

5. **The Cisco IOS CLI**  
   - Introduction to Cisco's Command Line Interface (CLI) for configuring network devices.  

6. **Ethernet LAN Switching**  
   - How Ethernet switching works, MAC addresses, and collision domains.  

7. **IPv4 Addressing**  
   - Understanding IPv4 address structure, subnetting, and addressing schemes.

## **Part 2: Routing Fundamentals and Subnetting**  

1. **Routing Fundamentals**  
   - How routers forward packets, routing tables, and administrative distance.  

2. **The Life of a Packet**  
    - Step-by-step journey of a packet through a network, from source to destination.  

3. **Subnetting IPv4 Networks**  
    - Breaking down IPv4 subnets, subnet masks, and CIDR notation.

## **Part 3: Layer 2 Concepts**  

1. **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**  
    - What VLANs are, their benefits, and how they segment network traffic.  

2. **Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)**  
    - Protocols that help manage VLANs across multiple switches.  

3. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**  
    - Preventing network loops in Layer 2 networks and ensuring redundancy.  

4. **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**  
    - Faster convergence of STP to minimize downtime in network changes.  

5. **EtherChannel**  
    - Combining multiple links into one logical link to increase bandwidth and redundancy.

## **Part 4: Dynamic Routing and First Hop Redundancy Protocols**  

1. **Dynamic Routing**  
    - Understanding routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP.  

2. **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**  
    - OSPF routing protocol concepts, link-state advertisements, and area-based routing.  

3. **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)**  
    - Ensuring network availability using HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP.

## **Part 5: IPv6**  

1. **IPv6 Addressing**  
    - Structure of IPv6 addresses, benefits over IPv4, and address types.  

2. **IPv6 Routing**  
    - How routing works in IPv6, static and dynamic routing protocols like OSPFv3.  

---

## **Part 6: Layer 4 and IP Access Control Lists (ACLs)** 
 
1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**  
    - The difference between TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (faster, connectionless).  

2. **Standard Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
    - Filtering traffic based on source IP addresses to control network access.  

3. **Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
    - More advanced filtering using source/destination IP, ports, and protocols.
