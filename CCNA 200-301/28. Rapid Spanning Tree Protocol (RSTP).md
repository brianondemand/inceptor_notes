As we learned, the original Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) (IEEE 802.1D) effectively prevents loops in a network with redundant paths. However, one of its main drawbacks is its relatively slow convergence time. When a network topology change occurs (e.g., a link failure), it can take 30 to 50 seconds for STP to recalculate the topology and bring a redundant link into a forwarding state. This downtime can be significant for modern networks.

**Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**, standardized as IEEE 802.1w, is an evolution of STP designed to provide much faster convergence after a topology change. It retains the fundamental goal of preventing loops but introduces new mechanisms and refinements to significantly reduce the time it takes for the network to recover from failures.

Think of RSTP as a faster and more efficient version of the STP traffic cop. It can identify and resolve network loops much more quickly, minimizing disruption.


RSTP achieves its faster convergence through several key improvements and concepts compared to STP:

1. **Port States:** RSTP reduces the number of port states from five to three:
    
    - **Discarding:** Similar to Blocking and Listening in STP. The port is not forwarding traffic or learning MAC addresses.
    - **Learning:** The port is not yet forwarding traffic but is learning MAC addresses.
    - **Forwarding:** The port is forwarding traffic and learning MAC addresses.
  
2. **Port Roles:** RSTP clarifies and expands the port roles:
    
    - **Root Port:** Remains the same – the port with the best path to the Root Bridge.
    - **Designated Port:** Remains the same – the port on a segment with the best path to the Root Bridge.
    - **Alternate Port:** A new role. This port offers an alternate path to the Root Bridge and is in the Discarding state. It can quickly transition to the Root Port role if the current Root Port fails.
    - **Backup Port:** Another new role. This port provides a redundant path to the same network segment as the Designated Port. It is in the Discarding state and can quickly transition to the Designated Port role if the current Designated Port fails.
    - **Disabled Port:** Remains the same – administratively shut down.
  
3. **BPDU Format:** RSTP uses a slightly different BPDU format (Version 2 BPDUs) that allows for faster communication of topology changes. RSTP BPDUs also include flags that indicate the port role and state of the sending port.

4. **BPDU Propagation:** In STP, only the Root Bridge initially generates BPDUs. Non-Root Bridges forward these BPDUs. In RSTP, all active bridge ports generate BPDUs. This allows for faster detection of link failures.

5. **Topology Change Notification (TCN):** RSTP has a more efficient mechanism for handling topology changes. When a switch detects a topology change, it immediately sends a BPDU with the Topology Change (TC) flag set. This information is quickly flooded across the network, allowing switches to rapidly flush their MAC address tables and avoid forwarding traffic to incorrect destinations.

6. **Agreement Mechanism:** RSTP introduces an "agreement" mechanism that allows a Designated Port and a Root Port on a point-to-point link to quickly transition to the Forwarding state without waiting for the Forward Delay timers. This happens when the Designated Port sends a BPDU proposing its role and the downstream switch (with the Root Port) agrees.

7. **Link Types:** RSTP can automatically detect the link type of a port:
    
    - **Point-to-Point:** A direct link between two switches (full-duplex is assumed for rapid transition).
    - **Shared:** A link connected to a hub or a segment with multiple devices (half-duplex).
    - **Edge:** A port connected to an end device (like a PC or printer) that will not generate BPDUs. Ports configured with PortFast are treated as edge ports in RSTP.

**Key Benefits of RSTP over STP:**

- **Faster Convergence:** Significantly reduces the time it takes for the network to recover from topology changes (typically in seconds).
- **Improved Efficiency:** More efficient BPDU exchange and topology change notification.
- **Better Link Utilization:** Alternate and Backup ports provide quicker failover.

### RSTP Configurations

Configuring RSTP is generally straightforward, as many modern switches default to RSTP or have it as a simple configuration option. Here's how you would typically configure RSTP (IEEE 802.1w) on a Cisco switch (which often implements a per-VLAN version called **Rapid PVST+ (RPVST+)**):

1. **Verify STP Mode:** First, check the current spanning tree mode.

```
show spanning-tree mode
```

- If it's not `rapid-pvst`, you can change it globally:

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

end
```

- This command sets the spanning tree mode to Rapid PVST+, which runs a separate instance of RSTP for each VLAN.

2. **Configure the Root Bridge:** Similar to PVST+, you influence the Root Bridge election by manipulating the Bridge Priority. Lower priority is preferred.

- **Primary Root Bridge:**

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 4096  // Lower priority for VLAN 10

spanning-tree vlan 20 priority 4096  // Lower priority for VLAN 20

end
```

- **Secondary Root Bridge:**

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 8192  // Higher priority than primary for VLAN 10

spanning-tree vlan 20 priority 8192  // Higher priority than primary for VLAN 20

end
```

- You can also use the `root primary` and `root secondary` commands:

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary

spanning-tree vlan 20 root secondary

end
```


 - The `root primary` command in RPVST+ sets the priority to 24576 (or a lower multiple of 4096 if the current priority is already lower) and configures the switch to try and become the root. The `root secondary` command sets the priority to 28672, making it a likely backup root.

3. **Configure PortFast:** In RSTP, the concept of PortFast remains, and it's configured similarly for ports connected to end devices. When enabled, it allows the port to immediately transition to the Forwarding state. **BPDU Guard is still highly recommended on PortFast-enabled ports.**

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/1

spanning-tree portfast

spanning-tree bpduguard enable

interface GigabitEthernet0/4

spanning-tree portfast

spanning-tree bpduguard enable

end
```


- In RSTP, a PortFast-enabled port is considered an **edge port**. It assumes there are no other switches connected to it. If an edge port receives a BPDU, it immediately loses its edge port status and behaves like a normal spanning tree port.


4. **Configure Link Type (Optional but Recommended):** While RSTP can often auto-detect link types, you can explicitly configure a port as point-to-point if you know it's a direct link to another switch and operating in full-duplex. This can help speed up convergence.

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/2

spanning-tree link-type point-to-point

end
```

- For ports connected to hubs or shared media (rare in modern networks), you might configure `spanning-tree link-type shared`.

5. **Configure Path Costs (Optional):** You can still manually adjust path costs if needed to influence the RSTP topology. The default cost values might differ slightly from legacy STP based on the interface bandwidth.

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/5

spanning-tree vlan 10 cost 20

spanning-tree vlan 20 cost 30

end
```


6. **Verification:** Use the `show spanning-tree` command to verify the RSTP status for all VLANs or a specific VLAN. Look for the `Protocol` to be `RSTP` and examine the port roles and states.

```
  show spanning-tree vlan 10
  
  show spanning-tree interface GigabitEthernet0/1 detail
 ```


- The output will show the port roles (Root, Designated, Alternate, Backup), the port states (Discarding, Learning, Forwarding), and other RSTP-specific information.


**Key Considerations for RSTP:**

- **Consistency:** For RSTP to function optimally and achieve rapid convergence, all switches in the network should support and be running RSTP. Mixing STP and RSTP can lead to slower convergence times and potential issues.
- **Full Duplex:** RSTP's rapid transition mechanisms on point-to-point links rely on full-duplex operation. Ensure that links between switches are configured for full duplex.

By understanding these concepts and configurations, you can effectively deploy and manage networks using the benefits of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. It provides a significant improvement in network resilience and responsiveness compared to the original STP.
