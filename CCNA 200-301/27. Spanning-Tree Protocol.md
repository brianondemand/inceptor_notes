The short answer to this question is - **Ethernet does not work in redundant topologies** because of Ethernet loops also called layer-2 loops or broadcast storms. Without a technology that breaks the LAN with redundant links into a loop-free topology, BUM (broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast) frames would **loop around indefinitely** until a link or a device just fails. This happens because of the way switches flood BUM frames. Let's dive into this problem in the next chapters.

**IMPORTANT**  Ethernet does not work in looped switched topologies such as a triangle of interconnected switches. A technique that breaks the topology into a loop-free one must be used (such as Spanning-Tree).

## Switches and BUM frames

When a switch receives a frame, it checks the destination MAC address against its MAC table and if there is no matching entry, it forwards the frame out all interfaces except the incoming one. This process is called ***flooding*** and the frame whose destination MAC is unknown is called an ***unknown unicast***.

The main idea here is that - ==if you don't know where exactly to deliver a frame, **send it out everywhere**, and the recipient will eventually get it==. And it is also likely that the receiver will reply, therefore the switch will learn both nodes' MAC addresses and continue the future forwarding process as ***known-unicast*** (not flooding the frames). 

Switches also flood two other types of frames:

- **broadcast** \- ones destined to the Ethernet broadcast address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF;
- **multicast** \- ones destined to MAC address which starts with bits '1110'.

Figure 1 shows an example in which PC1 sends out a single broadcast frame. Based on the destination MAC address, switch 1 knows that this is broadcast and therefore, sends a copy out all its ports except the incoming one. So a copy of the frame goes to SW2 and SW3, which perform the same logic. Ultimately, every node in this broadcast domain gets a copy of this packet.

Figure 1. LAN with no redundant links

Everything works fine in the above LAN topology except that there is no redundancy in case of a failure. Let's see what will happen if we introduce a redundant link between SW2 and S3.

## Ethernet loops (Broadcast storms)

If there is a looped switching topology like the one shown in figure 2 and there is no Spanning-Tree running, three main problems occur: 

#### Problem 1 - Even one looping frame causes a *broadcast storm*.

This happens when a BUM (broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast) frame loops around the switches **indefinitely**. A broadcast storm keeps going until a link is oversaturated and fails or a switch crashes because of a high CPU usage. To help you visualize this concept, we have created the animation shown in figure 2. Note that all port LEDs are blinking very rapidly, typically simultaneously and the switches are running at a very high CPU. The process will go on until something fails and break the loop. Let's look at why this happens?

![Redundant LAN without Spanning-Tree](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/redundant-lan-without-stp.gif)

Figure 1. Redundant LAN without Spanning-Tree

Ethernet logic tells switches to flood BUM frames on all ports except the incoming interface. If we apply this logic to our example shown in figure 2, let's see what happens:

- SW1 receives a broadcast frame on the link SW1-SW2, it sends a copy out all its ports (to SW3 and to PC1) except the incoming interface (link SW1-SW2);
- SW3 gets the broadcast frame and applies the same logic. It sends a copy out all its ports except the one the frame came in. So it sends the broadcast to SW2 and PC3.
- SW2 gets the frame, it sends a copy out all its ports except the incoming link SW3-SW2. So it sends the broadcast to SW1 and PC2.
- And the process repeats and goes on indefinitely.

Also, note that the same loop happens in the opposite direction.

#### Problem 2 - The storm causes another problem called *MAC table instability*.

If we recall the MAC learning process, when a switch receives a frame, it creates an entry in the MAC address table for the source address and the incoming port. But in case of a broadcast storm, multiple copies of the same frame loop around and the switch receives it on multiple interfaces. But a single MAC address can be tied to one interface only. Therefore the switch is constantly rewriting the entry for the source MAC address with a different interface and hence the instability. 

In the output below, you can see that while a loop is present, every time we check the MAC address table of a switch, the highlighted MAC address is tied to a different port.

   1    00d0.979a.eb83    DYNAMIC     Fa0/3
```

#### Problem 3 - End devices receive multiple copies of the same frame.

The last issue that occurs in a case of a loop is that end clients receive multiple copies of the looping frames over and over again while the broadcast storm is active. As a result, end clients may experience high CPU, and critical applications may starve of resources and fail. 

If you look at PC1 for example, you can see that it receives multiple copies of the same frame (the black dot representing a single broadcast frame). If this is an ARP frame, for example, PC1 would decapsulate each one of them and process it, which can lead to high CPU.

## Summary

It is important for network engineers to understand that Ethernet just does not work in looped switched topologies. That's is why we need a protocol that can break the loop topology into a loop-free one. 

| Problem | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Broadcast Storm | Broadcast Frames loop around the LAN indefinitely until a link or switch fails or is shut down by a network administrator. |
| MAC address table instability | Switches update their MAC address tables with incorrect entries over and over, resulting in frames being sent to wrong destinations and high CPU and memory usage. |
| End clients receive multiple copies of the same frame | End clients receive a high volume of duplicated frames that can cause high CPU resulting in application failures. |

#### What STP does?

The short answer is that Spanning-Tree prevents loops by **breaking the redundant physical topology into a logical loop-free one**.

## Creating a logical topology

High availability is paramount in networking so we always want to have redundancy at all layers in our network. Let's look at the simplest of LAN topologies as an example. In figure 1 we can see two interconnected Ethernet switches. If we have clients connected to SW1 and clients connected to SW2 we would like to have a redundant connection between the switches. Otherwise, if the link between them fails, clients on SW1 lose connection to clients on SW2.

![Looped topology with two Ethernet switches](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/looped-topology-with-two-switches.gif)

Figure 1. Looped topology with two Ethernet switches

But what happens when we introduce a second link between SW1 and SW2 - we have a looped topology. Remember what we have learned in our previous lesson - ==Ethernet does not work in looped topologies==. 

When Spanning-Tree is enabled on a switch (it is by default on all Cisco switches), it controls the state of every switch port and places each one in either a forwarding or a blocking state where:

- Ports in **forwarding state** send and receive frames and act as normal switch interface. In our examples, these ports are shown in green.
- Ports in **blocking state** do not process any frames except for Spanning-Tree messages and do not learn MAC addresses. In the examples, these ports are shown in orange.

Using this logic, Spanning-Tree breaks the looped physical topology into a loop-free logic topology. Let's visualize this with the example shown in figure 2. We have a triangle of interconnected switches. This creates a looped topology and Spanning-Tree detects that by exchanging messages over each link. In the end, STP places ports highlighted in green in forwarding state and the one in orange in blocking state. This results in the logical topology presented on the right. You can see that logically there is a loop-free topology.

![Redundant LAN with Spanning-Tree](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/lan-with-spanning-tree-example-1.gif)

Figure 2. Redundant LAN with Spanning-Tree

The same logic applies to larger topologies with many redundant links. If we look at figure 3 for example, we can that there are multiple looped topologies. Hence the STP protocol must block a few ports in order to achieve the loop-free topology shown on the right.

![Redundant LAN with Spanning-Tree Example 2](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/lan-with-spanning-tree-example-2.gif)

Figure 3. Redundant LAN with Spanning-Tree

Let's look at one more example with a higher number of switches. Note how many ports must be placed in a blocking state by Spanning-Tree in order to achieve a loop-free topology. It is important to understand that Spanning-Tree is controlling the topology by placing blocking individual ports and not links.

Figure 4. Redundant LAN with Spanning-Tree

## Summary

Spanning-Tree prevents loops by **breaking the redundant physical topology into a logical loop-free one**. At the same time, it tracks the status of all inter-switch links and upon link failure, a new loop-free topology is calculated.

## How Spanning-Tree works

Spanning-Tree is based on an algorithm invented by Radia Perlman in 1985 and was published in a paper called "An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN".  The algorithm creates a loop-free topology by selecting a single root bridge and then all other switches calculate a single least-cost path to the root.

## The STP Algorithm

The Spanning-Tree algorithm performs a couple of steps to make sure that the topology is loop-free and Ethernet is going to work correctly:

1. **Electing a Root Bridge** - The very first thing that STP does is to elect a Root Bridge. This is the most important switch in the topology. It will be the root of the loop-free tree.
2. **Finding looped topologies** - Once the Root Bridge is elected, it starts sending Spanning-Tree messages called BPDU. Based on these messages the switches find the looped parts of the topology.
3. **Setup port roles** - After the looped part of the topology is identified, each switch places as many switch ports as needed in order to ensure that the topology is loop-free.
4. **Re-converge around failures** - The switches continue to exchange messages in order to keep track of links and adjacent switches' availability. If a link or a switch goes down, the switches execute step 2 and step 3 again to make sure the new topology is loop-free.

**NOTE**  The term **Bridge** appears a lot in the context of Spanning-Tree because the protocol was created in times when switches had not even existed and local networks were using devices called bridges. That is why most protocol terms like **Bridge-Priority** and **Bridge-ID** are not **Switch-Priority** and **Switch-ID**. However, in the context of STP, both terms are really synonymous and interchangeable.

This is a simplified summary of the STP algorithm. Let's now look at each step in more detail. 

### Root Bridge Election

Switches elect a Root Bridge based on a value called Bridge ID. The switch that has the lowest BID value is elected the Root Bridge of the topology. BID is not a single value, but it is composed of two different value types.

BID = (Priority + VLAN number) : (System MAC address)

The first portion of the BID value is configurable and is used by network administrators to set up a particular switch as a Root Bridge.

The second part of the BID value is only used when there is a tie, meaning when there are at least two switches that have the same priority value. This typically happens when all switches are left with their default values, therefore all switches have a priority of 32768. In this case, the election process is decided by choosing the switch with the lowest Systems MAC address. 

When a switch boots up, it does not know the BID values of all other switches in the topology. ==Thus it elects itself as the Root Bridge of the topology.== Once it receives a BPDU with a Root BID value lower than its own, it immediately stops advertising itself as root and starts forwarding the superior Root Bridge value. 

![Root-Bridge Election process step 1](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/root-bridge-election-process-step-1.svg)

Figure 1. Root-Bridge Election process step 1

Let's look at the example in figure 1. It shows three switches with default configurations that have been connected in a triangle and just powered on. The Spanning-Tree process starts with all switches electing and advertising themselves as Root Bridge of the topology.  In the BPDU messages, they put their own BID value and the BID of the root bridge known to them at the moment. Each switch is basically saying "I am the Root".

![Root-Bridge Election process step 2](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/root-bridge-election-process-step-2.svg)

Figure 2. Root-Bridge Election process step 2

Let's now look at the example in figure 2 and see what happens when they exchange the first BPDU messages. SW2 receives two BPDU messages, one from SW1 and one from SW3.

- The BPDU from SW1 says that the Root Bridge has a value of 32769:0000.0000.0001.  When SW2 compares this value to the Root Bridge value known to him at the moment 32769:0000.0000.0002 - it is obviously lower. A BPDU message that has a lower Root BID value than your own is called a **Superior BPDU**. Once SW2 gets this superior message, it stops advertising itself as root and starts forward this Superior BPDU downstream to all other switches. ==Downstream means that it stops sending BPDUs toward the Root but only to other bridges.==
- The BPDU received from SW3 has a Root-BID value of 32769:0000.0000.0003.  When SW2 compares this to the Root Bridge value known to him at the moment 32769:0000.0000.0002 - it is obviously higher. A BPDU message that has the same or higher Root BID value than your own is called an **Inferior BPDU**. Once SW2 gets this inferior message, it discards it.

At the end of this process, all switches within the topology must agree that there is only one Root Bridge and it is the same from the perspective of each bridge.

### Detecting Loops

Once the Root election is completed, the switches start identifying loops. A switch understands that there is a loop when it receives BPDUs from the Root-Bridge on more than one interface.  

If a switch receives Superior BPDUs on more than one port, there must be a loop and that port must be placed in Blocking State.

A key to correctly understand how this works is to understand what Superior BPDU is. A Superior BPDU has one of the following properties in that order:

1. Lower cost to the Root Bridge.
2. Lower neighbor bridge ID.
3. Lower neighbor port priority.
4. Lower neighbor internal port number.

Let's leave this process here and not dive into more details for now. In the next section, we are going to deep dive into this process and will do many labs and examples.

![Detecting Loops between three switches](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/spanning-tree-detecting-loops-example-2_0.svg)

Figure 3. Detecting Loops between three switches

#### Setting up the port roles

Once the topology is converged and each switch has placed its ports in the correct roles, BPDUs are still exchanged in order to track the link availability. If any switch detects a topology change, all switches re-calculate their port roles in order to create another loop-free topology.

![Spanning-Tree Port Roles](https://www.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/inline-images/spanning-tree-port-roles.svg)

Figure 4. Spanning-Tree Port Roles

There are three main port roles as shown in the example in figure 4.

| Port Roles | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Root Port | The root port represents the best path towards the Root Bridge. The switch must be receiving BPDUs with the lowest cost to the root on this port.  The switch does not send BPDUs via this port.  The switch learns MAC addresses on this port. |
| Designated Port | A port that points away from the root (downstream port).  BPDUs are being sent out this port.  The switch learns MAC addresses on this port. |
| Blocked Port | The switch does not learn MAC addresses on this port. The port does not forward any Ethernet traffic. |

Let's leave this here as well. We are going to be talking a lot more about each of the roles in the next lessons.
