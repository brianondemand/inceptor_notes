Connected routes provide a route to a network the router’s interface is directly connected to, and Local routes provide a route to the router’s own IP address. However, for the router to be able to send traffic to destinations not directly connected to the router itself, Connected and Local routes are not enough. Static routes enable routers to send packets to remote destinations not directly connected to the router itself. Unlike Connected and Local routes, static routes are not automatically added to the routing table and must be manually configured.

## Connected and Local Routes

We Connected and local routes, we configured R1, so this time let’s start from R2.

![What-is-routing](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12c62-what-is-routing.webp?w=1201)

Here are **R2’s configurations.** We are configuring IP addresses on R2’s G0/0 and G0/1 interfaces and enabling both interfaces with **no shutdown**.

![C-L-routes-review](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/d3df4-c-l-routes-review.webp?w=1201)

Recall, when you configure IP addresses on router interfaces, connected and local routes are added automatically in the routing table. One connected route and one local route per interface are added. So we can expect to find four routes already added in R2’s routing table. Remember, if an interface is disabled the connected and local routes for that interface will not appear in the routing table.

The connected routes are routes to the networks which R2’s interfaces are connected to. So there should be one route to 192.168.12.0/24 and one route to 192.168.24.0/24. And then the local routes are to the exact IP addresses configured on R2’s interfaces, so there should be a route to 192.168.12.2/32 and a route to 192.168.24.2/32.

Here are the routes.

![R2-show-ip-route](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/36397-r2-show-ip-route-3.webp?w=1201)

As expected, R2 has two connected routes: one to 12.0/24 and one to 24.0/24. R2 also has two local routes, one to 12.2/32 and one to 24.2/32.

## Static Routes Configuration

Here is the format of the command. From global config mode:

```command
ip route <ip-address> <netmask> <next-hop>
```

### Static route configuration (R1)

First, let’s configure R1’s route to 192.168.4.0/24.

```command
ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3
```

Next, we check R1’s routing table.

### Static route configuration (R3)

R3 needs two routes, one to 1.0/24 and one to 4.0/24. Here are the commands:

```command
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.34.3
```

![ip-route-configuration](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ff621-ip-route-configuration-14.webp?w=1201)

### Static route configuration (R4)

```command
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.34.3
```

![ip-route-C-L-routes](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2f9d6-ip-route-c-l-routes-15.webp?w=1201)

## Default route configuration

A default route is configured as follows:

```command
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>
```

Here’s an example:

```command
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
```

## Command Review

```command
ipconfig
ipconfig /all
show running-config | include ip route
ip route <destination-network> <subnet-mask> <exit-interface> <next-hop>
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.3
no ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.3
```

## Configuring static routes – Lab 

![Config-Static-Routes-Day11-lab](https://itnetworkingskills.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/f5a7b-config-static-routes-day11-lab-24.webp?w=1201)



**1\. Configure the PCs and routers according to the network diagram (hostnames, IP addresses, etc.). Remember to configure the gateway on the PCs. (You don’t have to configure the switches.)**

- Set the default gateway and IP address for each of PC1 and PC2

- On routers 1, 2, and 3, set the hostname and configure the interfaces.

For example, on R1 configure the interfaces:

1) Set the IP address on g0/1, add a description, and enable the interface.

2) Set the IP address on g0/0, add a description, and enable the interface.

3) Check with show ip interface brief.

**2\. Configure static routes on the routers to enable PC1 to successfully ping PC2.**

**Step 1:** consider what static routes you need to configure. You need two-way reachability, i.e., R1, R2, and R3 each need a route to both PC1’s (192.168.1.0/24) and PC2’s (192.168.3.0/24) networks.

**Step 2:** configure the routes.

**Step 3:** check the configured static route with show ip route.

>**Router-1:** 

- has a route to 192.168.1.0/24.  

- needs a route to 192.168.3.0/24.

```
R1(config)#  ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
```

>**Router-2:**

- needs a route to 192.168.1.0/24.  

- needs a route to 192.168.3.0/24.

```
R2(config)#  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
```

```
R2(config)#  ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3
```

>**Router-3:**

- has a route to 192.168.3.0/24.  

- needs a route to 192.168.1.0/24.

```
R3(config)#  ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2
```
