Imagine you have a network with multiple switches. To provide redundancy and ensure your network stays up even if one link fails, you might create multiple paths between these switches. However, having multiple active paths can lead to two major problems in Ethernet networks:

1. **Broadcast Storms:** When a switch receives a broadcast frame, it forwards it out of all other ports. If there are redundant paths, these broadcast frames can loop endlessly through the network, consuming bandwidth and potentially crashing the network.
2. **MAC Address Table Instability:** Switches learn which MAC addresses are associated with which ports. If frames from the same MAC address arrive on different ports due to loops, the switch's MAC address table will constantly update incorrectly, leading to traffic being sent to the wrong destination.

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** is a Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) protocol designed to prevent these problems in a network with redundant paths. It works by logically blocking redundant paths, creating a loop-free logical topology while still providing physical redundancy.

If a primary link fails, STP will automatically detect this and unblock a redundant path, allowing traffic to flow again.

It was developed by Radia Perlman in 1985 and standardized as IEEE 802.1D.

Think of STP as a traffic cop for your network loops. It identifies the best paths and closes off the redundant ones to prevent chaos.


**NOTE:**

**Root Cost** (also called **Path Cost**) is a numerical value that helps switches decide **the best path to reach the Root Bridge** in a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) network. 

Collection of each outgoing port added together to the root.

1. **Root Port:** This is the port on a non-root bridge with the least path cost to the root bridge. There is only one root port on every switch (excluding the root switch itself), which provides the shortest path from that switch to the root bridge. It's always in the forwarding state if STP is converged.
   
2. **Designated Port:** A designated port is one that has the least cost path to the root bridge from its connected network (collision domain). In other words, if two switches are connected together, the switch with the lower path cost to the root bridge will have its port (connecting the two switches) as the designated port. Designated ports are always in the forwarding state if STP is converged.
   
3. **Non-Designated (Blocked) Port:** A non-designated port, also known as a blocked port, is one that is not a root or designated port. These ports are in a blocking state to prevent loops and do not participate in frame forwarding. They only listen to and process BPDUs.
   
4. **Disabled Port:** This port doesn’t participate in STP and doesn't forward frames, because it's been administratively shut down.

## Analyzing STP

STP operates by electing a root bridge (the central point in the network) and determining the shortest path from all switches to this root bridge. 

STP achieves its goal by performing the following key steps:

1. **Electing a Root Bridge:** The first step is to elect a single **Root Bridge** in the entire network. The Root Bridge acts as the central point of reference for all STP calculations. The switch with the lowest **Bridge ID (BID)** is elected as the Root Bridge. The BID consists of a configurable **Bridge Priority** (a 2-byte value, default is 32768) and the switch's **Base MAC Address** (a 6-byte globally unique identifier). Lower priority values are preferred. If priorities are the same, the switch with the lower MAC address wins.

2. **Electing Root Ports:** On every non-Root Bridge switch, one port is elected as the **Root Port**. The Root Port is the port that has the best (lowest cost) path back to the Root Bridge. The path cost is a value assigned to each link (interface) based on its bandwidth. Higher bandwidth links typically have lower costs. The path cost is cumulative. If a switch has multiple paths to the Root Bridge with the same cost, it will choose the port connected to the neighbor with the lower Bridge ID. If there's still a tie, it will choose the port with the lowest Port ID.

3. **Electing Designated Ports:** On each network segment (a link connecting two switches or a switch and an end device), one port is elected as the **Designated Port**. The Designated Port is the port on that segment that has the best (lowest cost) path back to the Root Bridge. On the Root Bridge itself, all its active ports are Designated Ports. If two ports on a segment have the same cost to the Root Bridge, the port on the switch with the lower Bridge ID is the Designated Port. If there's still a tie, the port with the lower Port ID is the Designated Port.

4. **Port States:** After the election process, each switch port will transition into one of the following STP states:
    
    - **Blocking:** The port is not forwarding traffic and not learning MAC addresses. It is listening for Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). This state prevents loops.
      
    - **Listening:** The port is not forwarding traffic but is listening for BPDUs to determine the network topology.
      
    - **Learning:** The port is not forwarding traffic but is learning MAC addresses.
      
    - **Forwarding:** The port is forwarding traffic and learning MAC addresses. This is the desired state for ports that are part of the loop-free topology.
      
    - **Disabled:** The port is administratively down and not participating in STP.

## STP Timers

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) uses three key timers to manage convergence and stability. These timers ensure that topology changes are handled efficiently while preventing loops.

### 1. Hello Timer

- **Default Value:** 2 seconds

- **Purpose:**

    - Determines how often BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) are sent by the root bridge.
    
    - Used to maintain communication between switches and detect topology changes.

- **Configuration Command:**

```bash
  spanning-tree hello-time [seconds]
```

    _(Range: 1 to 10 seconds)_


### 2. Forward Delay Timer

- **Default Value:** 15 seconds

- **Purpose:**

    - Controls the time a port spends in both the **Listening** and **Learning** states before transitioning to the **Forwarding** state.
    
    - Helps prevent loops by ensuring topology changes are fully propagated before forwarding traffic.

- **Formula for Convergence Delay:**
    
    - **Total Forwarding Delay = 2 × Forward Delay Timer** (30 seconds by default)

- **Configuration Command:**

```bash
  spanning-tree forward-time [seconds]
   ```

    (Range: 4 to 30 seconds)



### 3. Max Age Timer

- **Default Value:** 20 seconds

- **Purpose:**

    - Defines how long a switch will wait without receiving BPDUs before assuming the network topology has changed.

    - If the timer expires without receiving BPDUs, the switch will begin recalculating the spanning tree.

- **Configuration Command:**

```bash
  spanning-tree max-age [seconds]
 ```

    _(Range: 6 to 40 seconds)_
    


### STP Timer Calculation (Recommended Best Practice)

Cisco recommends using these formulas when modifying STP timers manually:

1. **Max Age = 2 × (Hello Time) + 1**

    - Example: If Hello Time = 2s → Max Age = (2 × 2) + 1 = 5s (default is 20s for safety)

2. **Forward Delay = (Max Age - 1) / 2**

    - Example: If Max Age = 20s → Forward Delay = (20 - 1) / 2 = 9.5s (rounded to 15s default)


### Tuning STP Timers

Manually adjusting STP timers is not recommended unless you have a well-planned network design. For most cases, **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)** is preferred since it automatically adjusts timers for faster convergence.

## PortFast

PortFast is a Cisco STP enhancement that **bypasses the standard STP learning process** on edge ports. It allows ports connected to end devices (like PCs, printers, or servers) to transition **immediately to the forwarding state** instead of waiting for STP convergence. (which take 30-50 seconds).

**The Problem PortFast Solves:**

In standard STP (and even RSTP, to a degree), when a port comes up, it goes through a series of states before it starts forwarding traffic:

* **Blocking (STP):** Not forwarding or learning.
* **Listening (STP):** Listening for BPDUs but not forwarding or learning.
* **Learning (STP/RSTP):** Not forwarding but learning MAC addresses.
* **Forwarding (STP/RSTP):** Forwarding traffic and learning MAC addresses.

These transitional states are necessary on inter-switch links to allow STP to detect and prevent loops. However, for ports connected to end devices, there's generally no risk of creating a Layer 2 loop through that single connection. The time spent in the Listening and Learning states (typically around 30 seconds in STP) can be frustrating for users as they have to wait for network connectivity after plugging in their device or booting up their computer.

**How PortFast Works:**

When you enable PortFast on a switch port, you are essentially telling the switch: "This port is connected to an end device, not another switch. I am confident that there is no possibility of a loop being created through this port. Therefore, you can skip the normal STP transitional states and immediately move this port to the Forwarding state when it comes up."

**Key Characteristics and Benefits of PortFast:**

* **Immediate Forwarding:** Ports configured with PortFast transition directly from the Blocking state (or Disabled) to the Forwarding state, bypassing the Listening and Learning phases. This significantly reduces the time it takes for end devices to gain network access.
  
* **Intended for Access Ports:** PortFast should **only** be enabled on ports connected to end-user devices. Enabling it on inter-switch links can create temporary forwarding loops during topology changes, defeating the purpose of STP.
  
* **BPDU Guard Recommendation:** Because PortFast ports are assumed to be connected to non-switch devices, they should not be sending or receiving STP Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). If a PortFast-enabled port *does* receive a BPDU, it could indicate a misconfiguration or a rogue switch being connected. To protect the STP topology in such cases, it's **highly recommended to enable BPDU Guard on all PortFast-enabled ports.** BPDU Guard will put the port into an error-disabled state if it receives a BPDU, preventing potential loops.
  
* **RSTP Considerations:** In Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), a port configured with the equivalent of PortFast is considered an **edge port**. Edge ports assume they are at the boundary of the STP topology and can immediately enter the Forwarding state. Similar to STP, receiving a BPDU on an RSTP edge port will cause it to lose its edge port status.

**Configuration (Cisco):**

You configure PortFast on a per-interface basis:

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable  // Highly recommended
 
end
```

## BPDU Guard & BPDU Filter (STP Toolkit)

**Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)** are special data frames that switches use to exchange STP information. They contain information about the sending switch's Bridge ID, Root Bridge ID, path cost to the Root Bridge, and more.

### BPDU Guard

This feature protects the network by shutting down ports that receive BPDUs when they shouldn't, such as ports connected to end devices. It prevents potential loops caused by unauthorized switches.​

When BPDU Guard is enabled on a switch port, if that port receives any BPDU, the port will immediately be put into an **error-disabled** state. This effectively shuts down the port and prevents any potential STP disruption.

BPDU Guard should typically be enabled on **access ports** – ports that are connected to end-user devices (PCs, printers, servers). End devices should not be sending BPDUs. Receiving a BPDU on an access port usually indicates a problem.

**Configuration (Cisco PVST):**

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```

```
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

- You can verify BPDU Guard status using commands:

```
show spanning-tree interface GigabitEthernet0/1 detail
```

---

### BPDU Filter

BPDU Filter is used to prevent a port from sending or receiving BPDUs.

When enabled, it can prevent the port from sending or receiving BPDUs, effectively stopping STP on that port.

When BPDU Filter is enabled on a port:

- **Sending:** The port will not send any BPDUs.
- **Receiving:** The port will ignore any BPDUs it receives.

BPDU Filter should be used with extreme caution. Incorrectly applying it can break STP and create loops. 

If you enable BPDU Filter on a port that should be participating in STP, that port will not be able to exchange STP information. This could lead to loops if there are redundant paths.


**Configuration (Cisco PVST- Global):** 

- Applying it globally affects all ports configured as portfast.

```
spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
```

**Configuration (Cisco PVST - Interface):**

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```

```
spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
```

---

## Root Guard

Root Guard prevents unexpected devices (**designated ports**) from becoming root ports. 

If a port enabled with Root Guard receives a superior BPDU (indicating another switch wants to become the root bridge), the port is moved to a **"root-inconsistent"** state, effectively blocking it to maintain the current root bridge's position.

In this state, the port will not forward traffic, and it will not participate in the Root Bridge election. Once the "rogue" BPDU stops arriving, the port will automatically return to its normal STP state.

This is important because the Root Bridge election should ideally be controlled and predictable. A rogue or misconfigured switch with a lower Bridge ID could potentially become the Root Bridge, disrupting the intended STP topology and potentially leading to suboptimal traffic flow.

**Where to Use:** Root Guard should be enabled on ports where you do not expect to receive superior BPDUs, typically on ports connecting to other switches that should _not_ become the Root Bridge. This is often on downstream switches connected to your primary Root Bridge.

**Configuration (Cisco PVST):**

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
```

```
spanning-tree guard root
```

**Verification:** 

- You can verify Root Guard status using commands like: 

```
show spanning-tree interface GigabitEthernet0/2 detail
```

- A port in the root-inconsistent state will show this in the STP port flags.

---

## Loop Guard

Loop Guard enhances STP stability by preventing alternative or root ports from becoming designated ports due to the absence of BPDUs. 

if a Designated Port stops receiving BPDUs, it will eventually transition to the Forwarding state, potentially creating a loop if the upstream switch is still forwarding.

Loop Guard monitors Designated Ports for the continuous reception of BPDUs. If a Designated Port stops receiving BPDUs from its upstream neighbor, Loop Guard will put the port into a **loop-inconsistent** state instead of allowing it to transition to Forwarding. 

This prevents the creation of a loop. The port will automatically recover and return to its normal STP state once it starts receiving BPDUs again.

**Where to Use:** Loop Guard should be enabled on all Designated Ports and Root Ports on switches where unidirectional link failures are a concern. This is generally a good practice on most switch ports that participate in STP.

**Configuration (Cisco PVST - Global):**

```
spanning-tree loopguard default
```

- This enables Loop Guard globally, applying it to all non-designated ports.


**Configuration (Cisco PVST - Interface):**

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
```

```
spanning-tree guard loop
```

**Verification:** 

- You can verify Loop Guard status using commands like:

```
show spanning-tree interface GigabitEthernet0/3 detail
```

- A port in the loop-inconsistent state will show this in the STP port flags.

## Configuring STP (PVST+)


Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+) is a Cisco enhancement of STP that allows for a separate spanning tree instance for each VLAN. This provides optimal load balancing and redundancy. To configure PVST+ on a Cisco switch:


Here's how you would typically configure basic PVST+ settings on a Cisco switch:

1. **Verify STP Mode:** Ensure that the spanning tree mode is set to PVST+. This is often the default on Cisco switches.

```
  show spanning-tree mode
```

- If it's not PVST+, you can change it globally:

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree mode pvst

end
```


2. **Configure the Root Bridge:** To designate a switch as the Root Bridge for a specific VLAN (or multiple VLANs), you would typically lower its Bridge Priority.

- **Primary Root Bridge:**

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 4096  // Lower priority for VLAN 10

spanning-tree vlan 20 priority 4096  // Lower priority for VLAN 20

end
```


Using the `priority` keyword allows you to set a specific priority value. Remember, lower is better. Cisco recommends using increments of 4096 (e.g., 0, 4096, 8192, ...) for easier management.

- **Secondary Root Bridge:** It's a good practice to configure a secondary Root Bridge with a slightly higher priority than the primary. This switch will take over if the primary Root Bridge fails.

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 8192  // Higher priority than primary for VLAN 10

spanning-tree vlan 20 priority 8192  // Higher priority than primary for VLAN 20

end
```


- Alternatively, you can use the `root primary` and `root secondary` commands, which automatically adjust the priority.

```
configure terminal

spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary

spanning-tree vlan 20 root secondary

end
```
 

3. **Configure PortFast:** PortFast is a feature used on access ports (connected to end devices) to allow them to transition directly to the Forwarding state, bypassing the Listening and Learning states. This speeds up the process of end devices getting network connectivity. **BPDU Guard should always be enabled on ports configured with PortFast.**

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 
interface GigabitEthernet0/4
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 
end
```


4. **Configure Path Costs (Optional):** You might need to manually adjust the path cost on certain interfaces to influence the STP topology.

```
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/5
 spanning-tree vlan 10 cost 20  // Set cost for VLAN 10
 spanning-tree vlan 20 cost 30  // Set cost for VLAN 20
 
end
```

5. **Verify STP Configuration:** Use the `show spanning-tree` command to view the STP status for all VLANs or a specific VLAN.

```
   show spanning-tree vlan 10
   show spanning-tree interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```

Remember that proper planning and configuration of STP are crucial for maintaining a stable and resilient network.
