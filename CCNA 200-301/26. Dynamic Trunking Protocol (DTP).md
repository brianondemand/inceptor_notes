**Dynamic Trunking Protocol,** is a trunking protocol that is developed and proprietary to Cisco which is used to automatically negotiate trunks between Cisco switches. Trunk negotiations are managed by DTP only if the port is directly connected to each other.

DTP is normally used on Cisco IOS switches to negotiate if the interface should become an access port or trunk.

By default, DTP is enabled, and the interfaces of your switches will be in “dynamic auto” or “dynamic desirable” mode. This means that your interface will be in trunk mode whenever you receive a DTP packet that requests to form a trunk.

### Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) Cisco Administrative Modes

Here are the trunking/switchport modes that are used to establish trunking between Cisco Catalyst switches. The DTP, Dynamic Trunking Protocol, ‘**switchport mode’** interface subcommand is used to define the administrative trunking mode that tells the interface whether to trunk always or not or negotiate to trunk or not.

**switchport mode access** – an access port does not act as a trunk interface and only allows one VLAN through that port. An interface in access mode becomes a nontrunk interface, regardless of whether the neighboring interface is a trunk interface.

**switchport mode trunk** – the trunk mode enables the interface to be set in permanent trunking mode and establishes negotiations to convert the neighboring link to become a trunk link though the switch interface becomes a trunk even if the neighbor interface is not.

**switchport mode dynamic auto** – this DTP mode makes the interface passively waits to receive a negotiation message to make itself a trunk, at which point the switch will respond and negotiate whether to use trunking. The switch interface becomes a trunk port if the neighboring interface is set to trunk or dynamic desirable mode. The switchport mode dynamic auto is the default mode for newer Cisco switches such as Catalyst 2960 and 3560 Series switches.

**switchport mode dynamic desirable** – this DTP mode lets the port to initiates trunking with another port by sending a negotiation message to dynamically choose whether to start using trunking. The interface becomes a trunk port if the neighboring interface is set to trunk mode, dynamic desirable mode, or dynamic auto mode. The switchport mode dynamic desirable is the default on older switches, such as the Catalyst 2950 and 3550 Series switches.

**switchport nonegotiate** – this command disables Dynamic Trunking Protocol.


### Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) Cisco Negotiated Interface Modes

DTP, Dynamic Trunking Protocol, negotiation involves the exchange of DTP frames between two neighboring interfaces. When an interface is configured in switchport dynamic auto or dynamic desirable modes, it will initiate DTP negotiation in order to select its own trunking operational mode.

When an interface is statically configured in access mode or trunk mode, it will normally participate in the DTP process by responding to DTP frames if it receives any.

The table below describes how an interface selects its trunking operational mode based on its own trunking administrative mode and the results of the DTP process.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Trunk Mode**|Dynamic Auto|Dynamic Desirable|Trunk|Access|
|Dynamic Auto|Access|Trunk|Trunk|Access|
|Dynamic Desirable|Trunk|Trunk|Trunk|Access|
|Trunk|Trunk|Trunk|Trunk|Limited connectivity|
|Access|Access|Access|Limited connectivity|Access|

### Here are some of its features:

- **Automatic negotiation:** DTP allows switches to automatically negotiate the formation of a trunk link without requiring manual configuration.
  
- **Four modes:** DTP has four modes: “dynamic auto”, “dynamic desirable”, “trunk”, and “access”. The mode selected on each switch determines the behavior of the negotiation process.
  
- **Proprietary protocol:** DTP is a proprietary protocol developed by Cisco and is only supported on Cisco devices.
  
- **Can pose security risks:** DTP can pose security risks if not configured properly, as it can allow unauthorized devices to form a trunk link with a switch.
  
- **Can improve network performance:** DTP can improve network performance by allowing switches to form trunk links automatically and efficiently manage network traffic.
  
- **Can cause issues in mixed environments:** DTP can cause issues in mixed network environments where non-Cisco devices do not support the protocol or do not behave as expected.

### Advantages of Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

- DTP simplifies the process of configuring and managing VLANs on a network. It enables network administrators to dynamically negotiate trunk links between switches without manual configuration.
  
- DTP reduces the risk of misconfiguration errors and simplifies the task of managing VLANs in large networks with multiple switches.
  
- DTP allows for automatic creation and deletion of VLANs on switches, which can save time and reduce the risk of configuration errors.
  
- DTP provides a quick and easy way to connect switches together and establish VLAN communication.

### Disadvantages of Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

- DTP can create security vulnerabilities in the network. It enables automatic negotiation of trunk links, which can lead to unauthorized switches being connected to the network, potentially compromising network security.
  
- DTP can result in increased network traffic due to the constant negotiation of trunk links between switches.
  
- DTP can lead to misconfiguration of VLANs in situations where a switch negotiates a trunk link with a different VLAN configuration than intended.
  
- DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, which means it may not be compatible with non-Cisco switches or other network devices. This can limit its usefulness in heterogeneous networks.
