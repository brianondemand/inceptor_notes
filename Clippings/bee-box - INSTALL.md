## Installation Steps

_No! I will not explain how to install VMware or VirtualBox..._

1. Extract the compressed file.  
2. Double-click on the VM configuration file (`bee-box.vmx`), or import the VM into the VMware software.  
3. Start the VM. It will log in automatically.  
4. Check the IP address of the VM.  
5. Go to the bWAPP login page. If you browse the bWAPP root directory, you will be redirected:  
   - Example: `http://[IP]/bWAPP/`  
   - Example: `http://[IP]/bWAPP/login.php`  
6. Login with the default bWAPP credentials or create a new user:  
   - **Default credentials:** `bee/bug`  
7. You are ready to explore and exploit the bee!
