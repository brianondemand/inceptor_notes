## Host Your Page on GitHub

With GitHub pages, GitHub allows you to host a webpage from your repository. Let's try to use GitHub Pages to host our repository.

## Create a New Repository

Start by signing in to GitHub. GitHub pages need a special name and setup to work, so we start by creating a new repository:

![GitHub Create New Repository](https://www.w3schools.com/git/img_github_new_repository.png)

This repository needs a special name to function as a GitHub page. It needs to be your GitHub `username`, followed by `.github.io`:

## Push Local Repository to GitHub Pages

We add this new repository as a remote for our local repository, we are calling it `gh-page` (for GitHub Pages).

Copy the `URL` from here:

![GitHub Copy Repository URL](https://www.w3schools.com/git/img_github_pages_repository_url.png)

And add it as a new `remote`:

### Example

```shell
git remote add gh-page https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git
```

Make sure you are on the `master` `branch`, then push the `master` `branch` to the new `remote`:

### Example

```shell
git push gh-page master

 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

**Note:** If this is the first time you are connecting to GitHub, you will get some kind of notification to authenticate this connection.

Check that the new repository has received all the files:

## Check Out Your Own GitHub Page

That looks good, now click the Settings menu and navigate to the Pages tab:

![Navigate to Pages tab, and see your URL](https://www.w3schools.com/git/img_github_pages_created_url.png)

The GitHub page is created, and you can click the URL to view the result!
