**WLAN** stands for **Wireless Local Area Network**.**** WLAN is a local area network that uses radio communication to provide mobility to the network users while maintaining the connectivity to the wired network. A WLAN basically, extends a wired local area network. WLAN’s are built by attaching a device called the access point(AP) to the edge of the wired network. Clients communicate with the AP using a wireless network adapter which is similar in function to an ethernet adapter. It is also called a LAWN is a Local area wireless network. 

The performance of WLAN is high compared to other wireless networks. The coverage of WLAN is within a campus or building or that tech park. It is used in the mobile propagation of wired networks. The standards of WLAN are HiperLAN, Wi-Fi, and IEEE 802.11. It offers service to the desktop laptop, mobile application, and all the devices that work on the Internet. WLAN is an affordable method and can be set up in 24 hours. WLAN gives users the mobility to move around within a local coverage area and still be connected to the network. Most latest brands are based on IEE 802.11 standards, which are the WI-FI brand name. 

### History

A professor at the University of Hawaii who’s name was Norman Abramson, developed the world’s first wireless computer communication network. In 1979, Gfeller and u. Bapst published a paper in the IEE proceedings reporting an experimental wireless local area network using diffused infrared communications. The first of the IEEE workshops on Wireless LAN was held in 1991. 

## Types of WLANs

As per IEEE standard WLAN is categorized into two basic modes, which are as follows:

1. **Infrastructure**:**** In Infrastructure mode, all the endpoints are connected to a base station and communicate through that; and this can also enable internet access. A WLAN infrastructure can be set up with: a wireless router (base station) and an endpoint (computer, mobile phone, etc). An office or home WiFi connection is an example of Infrastructure mode.
2. **Ad Hoc**:**** In Ad Hoc mode WLAN connects devices without a base station, like a computer workstation. An Ad Hoc WLAN is easy to set up it provides peer-to-peer communication. It requires two or more endpoints with built-in radio transmission.


#### Characteristics of WLAN

1. Seamless operation.
2. Low power for battery use.
3. Simple management, easy to use for everyone.
4. Protection of investment in wired networks.
5. Robust transmission technology.

#### Advantages of WLAN

1. Installation speed and simplicity.
2. Installation flexibility.
3. Reduced cost of ownership.
4. Reliability.
5. Mobility.
6. Robustness.

#### Disadvantages of WLAN

1. Slower bandwidth.
2. Security for wireless LANs is the prime concern.
3. Less capacity.
4. Wireless networks cost four times more than wired network cards.
5. Wireless devices emit low levels of RF which can be harmful to our health.

## The Evolution of Wi-Fi Technology and Standards

- **IEEE 802.11™** is the pioneering 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi standard mentioned above from 1997, and it is still referred to by that nomenclature. This standard and its subsequent amendments are the basis for Wi-Fi wireless networks and represent the world’s most widely used wireless computer networking protocols.
  
- **IEEE 802.11b™, or Wi-Fi 1**, was introduced to the market in 1999 with Apple’s announcement. It also operated at 2.4 GHz, but to reduce interference from microwave ovens, cordless phones, baby monitors, and other sources, and to achieve higher data rates, it incorporated modulation schemes called direct-sequence spread spectrum/complementary code keying (DSSS/CCK). Wi-Fi 1 enabled wireless communications at distances of ~38m indoors and ~140m outdoors.
  
- **IEEE 802.11a™, or Wi-Fi 2**, also introduced in 1999, was the successor to IEEE 802.11b. It was the first Wi-Fi specification to feature a multi-carrier modulation scheme (OFDM) to support high data rates, unlike Wi-Fi 1’s single-carrier design. It supported 5 GHz operation and its 20 MHz bandwidth supported multiple data rates.
  
- **IEEE 802.11g™, or Wi-Fi 3**, was introduced in 2003. It allowed for faster data rates of up to 54 Mbit/s in the same 2.4 GHz frequency band as IEEE 802.11b, thanks to an OFDM multi-carrier modulation scheme and other enhancements. This was appealing to mass market users, as 2.4 GHz devices were less expensive than 5 GHz devices.
  
- **IEEE 802.11n™, or Wi-Fi 4**, was introduced in 2009 to support the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz frequency bands, with up to 600 Mbit/s data rates, multiple channels within each frequency band, and other features. IEEE 802.11n data throughputs enabled the use of WLAN networks in place of wired networks, a significant feature enabling new use cases and reduced operational costs for end users and IT organizations.
  
- **IEEE 802.11ac™, or Wi-Fi 5**, was introduced in 2013 to support data rates at up to 3.5 Gbit/s, with still-greater bandwidth, additional channels, better modulation, and other features. It was the first Wi-Fi standard to enable the use of multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) technology so that multiple antennas could be used on both sending and receiving devices to reduce errors and boost speed.
