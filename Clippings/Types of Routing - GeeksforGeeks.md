Routing is the process of determining paths through a network for sending data packets. It ensures that data moves effectively from source to destination, making the best use of network resources and ensuring consistent communication. Routing performed by layer 3 (or network layer) devices to deliver the packet by choosing an optimal path from one network to another. It is an autonomous process handled by the network devices to direct a data packet to its intended destination. The node here refers to a network device called Router.

Routing is classified into Static Routing, Default Routing, and Dynamic Routing. In this article, we will see types of routing in detail.

Routing is essential for determining the optimal path for data packets across networks. Different routing techniques, such as static, dynamic, and hybrid, are used depending on the network. The [****GATE CS Self-Paced Course****](https://gfgcdn.com/tu/Ru9/) provides thorough coverage of routing algorithms, making it easier to grasp this critical networking concept


## Conclusion

Routing is an important concept that allows every network device across the world to share data with each other across internet. Shortest path is selected by the routing algorithms when routing a data packet. [Routing Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classification-of-routing-algorithms/) select the shortest path based on metrics like – hop count, delay, bandwidth etc. The core network device used in routing is router. Routes are stored in a logical data structure called – ‘****Routing Table****‘. Static routing is a process in which we have to manually add routes to the routing table , In Dynamic Routing packets are transmitted over a network using various shortest path algorithms and pre-determined metrics, Default Routing is a routing technique in which a router is configured to transmit packets to a default route that is, a gateway or next hop device if no specific path is defined or found. 

## Frequently Asked Questions on Types of Routing – FAQ’s

### How does a router work?

> Routes examines the IP in the header of every data packet received and if it belongs to it then it keeps the data packet else it re-routes it to other router based on some metrics.

### What is a Default Gateway?

> [Default gateway](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/default-gateway-in-networking/) is simply a router or another network device that allows the host to connect with other networks outside its local network. It is a crucial component for internetwork communication.

### What is the importance of routing?

> Routing chooses the routes along which Internet Protocol (IP) packets get from their source to their destination in packet-switching networks, such as the Internet.
