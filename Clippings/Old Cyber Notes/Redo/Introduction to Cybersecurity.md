## The Three Levels Of Protection


## 1. Personal Protection

On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices.

Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both **offline** and **online**.

**offline identity**

Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life, including your full name, age and address.

**online identity**

Your online identity is not just a name. It’s who you are and how you present yourself to others online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites.

Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online identity.

When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information. 

Some other useful tips to help you generate your username:

- Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
- Don’t use your email username.
- Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
- Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
- Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters, the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
- Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.

Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends.

Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.

**Types of Personal data**

1. Medical Records
2. Education records
3. Employment and financial records

### Where Is Your Data?

- Shared Photos on social media: The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your photos.
  
- Medical records: For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at the insurance company.
  
  - Purchasing products online: Store loyalty cards may be a convenient way to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners.

- Smart Devices: But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate information about you.

Social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course, these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data with their marketing partners.

### Who Else Wants My Data?

It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data.

**Internet service provider (ISP)**

Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to advertisers for a profit.

In certain circumstances, ISPs may be legally required to share your information with government surveillance agencies or authorities.

**Advertisers**

Targeted advertising is part of the Internet experience. Advertisers monitor and track your online activities such as shopping habits and personal preferences and send targeted ads your way.

**Search engines and social media platforms**

These platforms gather information about your gender, geolocation, phone number and political and religious ideologies based on your search histories and online identity. This information is then sold to advertisers for a profit.

**Websites you visit**

Websites use cookies to track your activities in order to provide a more personalized experience. But this leaves a data trail that is linked to your online identity that can often end up in the hands of advertisers!

## 2. Organizational Protection

At an organizational level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data and customers.

Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know there are two main types of data that you should be aware of.

#### Types of Organizational Data

#### 1. Traditional data

Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:

- **Transactional data** such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
- **Intellectual property** such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
- **Financial data** such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

#### 2. Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data

IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'

Organizations need to invest in improved security practices.

This might include:

- investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
- enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
- maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
- storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
- separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
- granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.

#### 3. Government Protection

As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

## Cyber Security Fundamentals 
 
#### 1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems.


- **Confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include **data encryption**, **identity proofing** and **two factor authentication**.
  
- **Integrity** ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a **hash function** or **checksum**.
  
- **Availability** means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by **maintaining equipment**, **performing hardware repairs**, **keeping operating systems and software up to date**, and **creating backups**.
  
#### 2. The protection of information in each of its possible states

- **Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).
  
- **Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).
  
- **Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

#### 3. The security measures used to protect data

- **Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
  
- **Technology** refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.
  
- **Policy and procedure** refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.

## Cyber Attackers

Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain.

#### 1. Amateurs

The term 'script kiddies' emerged in the 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. While script kiddies may use basic tools, their attacks can still have devastating consequences.

#### 2. Hackers

This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.

- **White hat attackers** break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
  
- **Gray hat attackers** may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
  
- **Black hat attackers** take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.


#### 3. Organized hackers

These attackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers. They are usually highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals.

Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness about issues that are important to them.

State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. They are usually highly trained and well-funded and their attacks are focused on specific goals that are beneficial to their government.

## Internal and External Threats

Cyber attacks can originate from within an organization as well as from outside of it.

#### Internal

Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally:

- mishandle confidential data

- facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization’s computer system

- invite malware onto the organization’s network by clicking on malicious emails or websites

- threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices.

#### External

Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:

- exploit vulnerabilities in the network

- gain unauthorized access to computing devices

- use social engineering to gain unauthorized access to organizational data.

## Cyberwarfare

Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.

#### The Purpose of Cyberwarfare

The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.

how are cyberwarfare is used: 

**To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets**

A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government.

**To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets**

A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government.


Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt its commerce, and cause its citizens to lose faith and confidence in their government without the attacker ever physically setting foot in the targeted country.

Cyberwarfare is a very serious issue with potentially devastating consequences, and attacks are becoming more widespread. Now, more than ever, nations and governments need cybersecurity professionals to help protect their citizens and infrastructure.
