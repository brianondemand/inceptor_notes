### The File System

Windows uses NTFS as its default file system, which supports large files, compression, encryption, and security permissions. FAT32 is older with a 4GB file size limit, while exFAT is designed for removable media with better performance than FAT32.

The file system uses drive letters (C:, D:, E:) to identify storage devices. Files are organized in folders with specific paths like C:\Users\Username\Documents. Important system folders include Program Files for applications, Users for profile data, Windows for system files, and Temp for temporary files.

File attributes include read-only (cannot be modified), hidden (not visible normally), system (critical files), and archive (modified since backup). The file system structure helps organize data and maintain system security through access controls.


### Supported File Systems in Windows

File Systems allow you to store data on your Hard Drive.

With Windows there are four primary File Systems that we are going to be working with:

First, there’s NTFS (New Technology File System). This is the most common you will be working with. When you are creating File Systems you most likely want to use NTFS. If you don’t remember anything about this lecture, just remember, when making a File System you probably would want to use NTFS.

Next, is the FAT32 (File Allocation Table). This is pretty outdated but still in use and we will talk more about it in a little bit.

We also have the exFAT(Extended File Allocation Table). It is kind of an updated version of FAT32.

Finally, we have the REFS (Resilient File System).

These systems are installed when you format a Volume on your Hard Disk. So, you create the Volume, and then you are requested to select what type of File System you want to put on that Volume.


Four primary Windows File System:

- NTFS (most common)
- FAT32
- exFAT
- REFS

#### NTFS (New Technology File System)

NTFS is the default file system used by Windows NT-based operating systems, starting in 1993 with Windows NT 3.1, all the way up to and including Windows 11. It offers advanced features like file permissions, encryption, compression, and journaling. NTFS supports large file and partition sizes, making it suitable for modern storage devices. However, it has limited compatibility with non-Windows operating systems.

**Advantages:**

- **Security and permissions:** NTFS provides a solid security model with file-level permissions. It allows you to set permissions for individual files and folders, controlling access rights for users and groups.
  
- **Trim support on solid-state drives (SSDs):** TRIM informs the drive about unused data, which allows the SSD to erase and prepare the space for future writes. TRIM is enabled by default, when NTFS file system is chosen to maintain its performance.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Disk errors and repairs:** Although NTFS is designed to be reliable, disk errors can still occur. When encountering disk errors, NTFS repairs can be time-consuming and may require special tools.
  
- **Fragmentation:** Over time, NTFS file systems can become fragmented, especially as files are created, modified and deleted. Fragmentation can lead to decreased performance as the system needs to access scattered file fragments.

#### FAT (File Allocation Table), FAT16, FAT32

FAT is one of the oldest and simplest file systems. It was initially developed for MS-DOS and is still used in many removable storage devices. The two major versions of this system are FAT16 and FAT32. FAT uses a file allocation table to keep track of file locations on the disk. However, it lacks some advanced features like file permissions and journaling, making it less suitable for modern operating systems. FAT 16 was introduces in 1987 with DOS 3.31 while FAT32 was introduced with Windows 95 OSR2(MS-DOS 7.1) in 1996.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity:** This simplicity makes it easy to implement and use, making it suitable for devices with limited resources or compatibility requirements.
  
- **Data recovery:** Due to its simple structure, FAT file systems are relatively easy to recover in case of data corruption or accidental deletion.
  
- **Compatibility:** It can natively be read from and written to by Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems without the need for third-party software.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Fragmentation:** Fragmentation occurs when file data is scattered across different parts of the disk, resulting in reduced performance. Regular defragmentation is required to optimise disk performance.
  
- **Lack of advanced features:** The newest version, FAT32, lacks several advanced features found in other file systems. It does not support file-level security permissions, journaling, encryption, or compression.
  
- **Volume name limitations:** The volume names for FAT16 and FAT32 cannot exceed 11 characters and cannot include most non-alphanumeric characters.
  
- **File name limitations:** Files on a FAT16 file system cannot exceed 8.3 character for their files names. This means 8 characters plus a 3 character file extension.

### exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

exFAT is a file system introduced by Microsoft as an improved version of FAT32. It addresses some of the limitations of FAT32, allowing for larger file sizes and better performance. exFAT is commonly used for removable storage devices, such as **external SSDs**, hard drives and SD cards as it provides compatibility across multiple operating systems. It was first introduced in 2006 as part of Windows CE 6.0.

**Advantages:**

- **Large file and partition size support:** exFAT supports much larger file sizes and partition sizes compared to FAT file systems. It can handle files bigger than 4 GB, making it suitable for storing large media files or disk images.
  
- **Efficient disk space utilisation:** exFAT improves disk space utilisation compared to older FAT file systems. It uses smaller cluster sizes, which reduces the amount of wasted disk space for smaller files.
  
- **Compatibility:** It can natively be read from and written to by Windows and MacOS operating systems without the need for third-party software.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Limited metadata support:** exFAT lacks some advanced features found in other modern file systems. It doesn’t support file-level security permissions, journaling, or file system-level encryption.
  
- **Fragmentation:** Like FAT file systems, exFAT is still susceptible to fragmentation. As files are created, modified, and deleted, fragmentation can occur leading to decreased performance over time.

#### A Resilient File System (ReFS)

A Resilient File System (ReFS) is a file system that Microsoft developed for use on a Windows operating system (OS) and is designed to overcome some of the limitations in the New Technology File System (NTFS). Microsoft developed the ReFS to improve its file system, specifically in data corruption resiliency and capacity.


**Advantages of using ReFS**


**Automatic integrity-checking and data-scrubbing**. The ReFS can detect and correct data corruption without requiring offline tools such as CHDSK. It also periodically scans the volume for latent errors and repairs them using redundant copies of data provided by Storage Spaces or mirror-accelerated parity.

**Scalability and performance**. The ReFS can easily handle large volumes (up to 1 yottabyte) and files (up to 16 exabytes). It also uses a B+ tree structure that reduces the number of I/O operations needed to access data. The ReFS also supports block cloning, which allows for the copying of large amounts of data with minimal I/O overhead, improving virtualization and backup workload performance.

**Storage virtualization and pooling**. The ReFS integrates with Storage Spaces, a feature that allows for the creation of flexible storage pools from multiple physical disks. Storage Spaces can provide different levels of resiliency, such as mirroring or parity, as well as tiering, which optimizes storage performance and capacity by moving hot and cold data between different types of drives, such as solid-state drives and hard disk drives.


**Disadvantages of using ReFS**

Windows cannot boot from the ReFS and requires the NTFS for the system drive.

The ReFS consumes more system resources than the NTFS, especially for large disk arrays.

The ReFS does not support some features the NTFS does, such as file compression, encryption, hard links, transactions and object IDs.

The ReFS cannot convert data from the NTFS without formatting the drive.
As such, the ReFS may not be suitable for some scenarios where performance, compatibility or functionality are important.
