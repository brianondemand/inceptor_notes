### Introduction to Windows

Windows is Microsoft's operating system that acts as an interface between users and computer hardware. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using windows, icons, and menus instead of text commands. The system uses a layered architecture with a kernel that manages hardware and system resources.

Windows operates in two modes: user mode for applications with limited access, and kernel mode for system services with full hardware access. This separation protects the system from harmful applications. The OS supports multitasking by rapidly switching between programs and allows multiple user accounts with separate settings and permissions.

The Windows API provides standard programming interfaces for developers, ensuring software works across different hardware configurations and contributing to Windows' large software library.

### Windows Editions

Windows Home is the basic consumer edition with essential features like Start menu, File Explorer, Microsoft Store, and Windows Defender security. It's designed for personal home computers.

Windows Pro adds business features including BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop access, Group Policy management, and Hyper-V virtualization. It targets small businesses and power users needing enhanced security and management tools.

Windows Pro for Workstations supports high-end hardware with multiple processors and up to 6TB memory. It includes advanced file systems and is designed for users with extreme performance needs.

Windows Enterprise and Education editions provide additional security features for large organizations and schools, including Application Guard, DirectAccess, and BranchCache. Server editions handle various organizational server needs.

**Windows 1.0**

Release date: November 20, 1985

The very first Windows version was somewhat successful but nothing especially memorable. Unlike other Windows versions, the software supported “tiling,” which did not allow windows to overlap on users’ screens. (Minor exceptions existed, such as for pop-up windows.)


**Windows 2.0**

Release date: December 9, 1987

Windows 2.0 allowed users to have overlapping windows. The version also supported both Microsoft Office Word and Excel, which had not been supported in Windows 1.0. However, it was not significantly different from Windows 1.0. Indeed, one critic noted, “The best that can be said for this…was that Windows remained a work in progress.”

**Windows 3.0**

Release date: May 22, 1990

This version finally popularized Windows as an operating system. Windows 3.0 allowed users to use more than 1 MB (megabyte) of RAM (random access memory; short-term memory used by a computer to multitask). In fact, the version let programs use up to 16 MB, more than had ever been allowed on prior OS versions. This capacity was instrumental in letting users operate multiple programs simultaneously.

**Windows 95**

Release date: August 24, 1995

The “Start” menu was introduced in this version of Windows and has stuck around ever since, providing a convenient portal to access programs, the file manager, and device settings. The popular Windows task bar was also included in Windows 95. In addition, users could minimize and maximize windows to reduce screen clutter. Windows 95 was considered to be more pleasing to the eye than previous versions because of its colorful, user-friendly interface, and it was the first 32-bit OS version (referring to the amount of data that can be processed without issue in a single operation).

**Windows XP**

Release date: October 25, 2001

Windows XP abandoned the long-used Windows 95 kernel (core software code) for a more powerful code base and offered a more practical interface and improved application and memory management. Another significant change was the addition of the Windows Error Reporting service, which allowed users to send reports to Microsoft when their systems malfunctioned. XP was released during the “golden age” of Microsoft innovation and remained in service far past its predicted lifespan. Although it ended technical support for the version in 2009, Microsoft released security updates for a number of years thereafter.

**Windows Vista**

Date released: January 30, 2007

Vista experienced a troubled rollout and was met with considerable marketplace resistance, quickly acquiring a reputation for being a large, slow, and resource-consuming OS version. Microsoft’s security advancements, designed to improve the user experience instead led to frustration when users attempted to download third-party applications. Additionally, though Vista’s graphical interface was intended to be an upgrade, many machines struggled to run its graphics because of issues with system requirements, making for an unpleasant visual display.

**Windows 7**

Date released: October 22, 2009

Although Windows 7’s interface was similar to that of Vista, it was met with enthusiasm because of its noticeable speed improvement and its modest system requirements. Moreover, Windows 7 allowed users to “pin” applications to the task bar. Whereas Windows 1.0 did not even allow users to have overlapping windows, Windows 7 offered the “Snap” feature for the first time, which automatically resized windows to fit users’ screens.

**Windows 8**

Date released: October 26, 2012

Windows 8 offered a Start screen (in lieu of the Start menu), with applications appearing as tiles on a grid and the ability to synchronize settings so users could log on to another Windows 8 machine and use their preferred settings. However, users complained that the new tiles interface was confusing, comparing it unfavorably to the simplicity of the Start menu in previous versions of Windows.

**Windows 10**

Date released: July 29, 2015

The older style of the Windows Start menu returned with Windows 10, which also came with Cortana, a digital personal assistant like Apple’s Siri, and the Web browser Microsoft Edge, which replaced the clunky, outdated Internet Explorer. Additionally, Windows 10 was the first OS version to be equally optimized for tablets, which had been steadily growing in popularity.

**Windows 11**

Date released: October 5, 2021

The newest Microsoft OS version features a redesigned Start menu and faster operating speeds. However, Cortana was removed from the OS, because its performance lagged behind competing virtual assistants, such as Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. Cortana was replaced, in some senses, by a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) feature known as Copilot in 2023. Using the large language model technology popularized by ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Copilot responds to user commands (for example, “Create a budgeting spreadsheet”) by generating new content. Furthermore, it is integrated into applications such as Microsoft 365 (which includes Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, among other programs), Bing, and the Windows task bar.

### The Desktop (GUI)

The Windows desktop is the main user interface. The desktop background can be customized with wallpapers. The taskbar at the bottom contains the Start button for accessing programs and settings, a search box for finding files and apps, and the system tray showing running background programs.

The Start menu displays frequently used apps, recently installed programs, and provides access to all applications and system functions. Window management allows users to minimize, maximize, restore, and close application windows. The Snap feature automatically arranges windows when dragged to screen edges.

Desktop icons provide shortcuts to files, folders, and applications. Users can customize the desktop by adding or removing icons and changing the background.


### Settings and the Control Panel

Windows provides two interfaces for system configuration. The modern Settings app includes System (display, sound), Devices (printers, Bluetooth), Network & Internet, Personalization, Apps, Accounts, Time & Language, Gaming, Privacy, and Update & Security sections.

The traditional Control Panel offers more detailed options including System and Security, Network and Internet, Hardware and Sound, Programs, User Accounts, and Administrative Tools. Many functions are available in both interfaces, though Microsoft is gradually moving features to the Settings app.

Key Control Panel tools include Device Manager for hardware management, Programs and Features for software installation/removal, and System for computer information and advanced settings. Both interfaces provide access to different aspects of system configuration and maintenance.

### Task Manager

Task Manager monitors and manages system processes and performance. Access it using Ctrl+Shift+Esc, Ctrl+Alt+Del, or right-clicking the taskbar. It provides several tabs for different functions.

The Processes tab shows running applications, background processes, and Windows processes with their resource usage. Users can end unresponsive tasks from here. The Performance tab displays real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network usage graphs.

The Startup tab manages programs that start with Windows, showing their impact on boot time. Users can enable or disable startup programs to improve system performance. The Details tab provides comprehensive process information including Process IDs and resource consumption.

Additional tabs include App History for tracking resource usage over time, Users for managing active user sessions, and Services for controlling Windows background services. Task Manager is essential for troubleshooting performance issues and managing system resources.


###  User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

Windows supports three main account types. Administrator accounts have full system access and can install software, manage other users, and modify system settings. Standard user accounts have limited access and cannot change system settings without administrator credentials. Guest accounts provide minimal temporary access for visitors.

User profiles are stored in C:\Users[Username] and contain personal folders like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and AppData. The AppData folder stores application-specific data with Roaming data that syncs across computers and Local data that stays on the machine.

File permissions control access levels including Full Control (all permissions), Modify (read, write, delete), Read & Execute (view and run), Read (view only), and Write (create files). These permissions help maintain security by limiting user access to appropriate files and folders.

### System Information

What is the **System Information** (`msinfo32`) tool?

Per Microsoft, "_Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues._"

The  information in **System Summary** is divided into three sections:

- **Hardware Resources**
- **Components**
- **Software Environment**

System Summary will display general technical specifications for the computer, such as processor brand and model.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/system-summary.png)

The information displayed in **Hardware Resources** is not for the average computer user. If you want to learn more about this section, refer to the official Microsoft [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/hardware-resources#:~:text=Hardware%20resources%20are%20the%20assignable,of%20bus%2Drelative%20memory%20addresses.).

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/hardware-resources.png)

Under **Components**, you can see specific information about the hardware devices installed on the computer. Some sections don't show any information, but some sections do, such as **Display** and **Input**.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/components.png)

In the **Software Environmen**t section, you can see information about software baked into the operating system and software you have installed. Other details are visible in this section as well, such as the **Environment Variables** and **Network Connections**. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/software-env.png)

Recall from the [Windows Fundamentals 1 room](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx) (The Windows\System32 Folder task) where **Environment Variables** was briefly touched on. 

Per [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.1), "_Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders._

_The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located_".

Click on `Environment Variables` to see the assigned values for the virtual machine.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/env-variables.png)

Another method to view environment variables is `Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables` **OR** `Settings > System > About > system info > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables`.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/env-variables2.png)

The detour is over. Let's redirect our attention back to `msinfo32` and pick up where we left off.

Towards the very bottom of this utility, there is a search bar. Please give it a go. Select Components and search for `IP address`.

### System Configuration

The **System Configuration** utility (`MSConfig`) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 

There are several methods to launch System Configuration. One method is from the Start Menu.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig-start.png)  

**Note**: You need local administrator rights to open this utility. 

The utility has five tabs across the top. Below are the names for each tab. We will briefly cover each tab in this task. 

1. General
2. Boot
3. Services
4. Startup
5. Tools

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig1.png)  

In the **General** tab, we can select what devices and services for Windows to load upon boot. The options are: **Normal**, **Diagnostic**, or **Selective**. 

In the **Boot** tab, we can define various boot options for the Operating System. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig2.png)  

The **Services** tab lists all services configured for the system regardless of their state (running or stopped). A service is a special type of application that runs in the background.  

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig3.png)  

In the **Startup** tab, you won't see anything interesting in the attached VM.  Below is a screenshot of the Startup tab for **MSConfig** from my local machine. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig4.png)  

As you can see, Microsoft advises using **Task Manager (**`taskmgr`**)** to manage (enable/disable) startup items. The System Configuration utility is **NOT** a startup management program. 

**Note**: If you open Task Manager for the attached VM, you will notice that Task Manager doesn't show a Startup tab. 

There is a list of various utilities (tools) in the Tools tab that we can run to configure the operating system further. There is a brief description of each tool to provide some insight into what the tool is for. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/msconfig5.png)  

Notice the **Selected command** section. The information in this textbox will change per tool.

To run a tool, we can use the command to launch the tool via the run prompt, command prompt, or by clicking the `Launch` button.

### Resource Monitor

What is **Resource Monitor** (`resmon`)?

Per Microsoft, "_Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes (either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application and potentially losing data._"

As some of the other tools mentioned in this room, this utility is geared primarily to advanced users who need to perform advanced troubleshooting on the computer system.  

In the Overview tab, Resmon has four sections:

- **CPU**
- **Disk**
- **Network**
- **Memory**

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon1.png)  

The same four sections have corresponding tabs across the top. See below.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon2.png)  

Note that each tab has additional information for each. An image is shown below for each tab. 

**CPU**

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon-cpu.png)  

**Memory**

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon-mem.png)  

**Disk**

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon-disk.png)  

**Network**

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/resmon-network.png)  

Although not captured in any of the images above, Resource Monitor has a pane at the far right. This pane shows a graphical view in real-time for each section. 

**Note**: The information displayed in Resource Monitor will be different for you compared to the images above.

### The Command Prompt 

The command prompt (`cmd`) can seem daunting at first, but it's really not that bad once you understand how to interact with it. 

In early operating systems, the command line was the sole way to interact with the operating system.

When the GUI (graphical user interface) was introduced, it allowed users to perform complex tasks with a few clicks of a button instead of entering commands in the command prompt. 

Even though the GUI is the primary way to interact with the operating system, a computer user can still interact via the command prompt. 

In this task, we'll only cover a few commands that a computer user can run in the command prompt to obtain information about the computer system.

Let's start with a few simple commands, such as `hostname` and `whoami`.

The command **hostname** will output the computer name.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/hostname.png)  

The command **whoami** will output the name of the logged-in user.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/whoami.png)  

Next, let's look at some commands that are useful when troubleshooting.

A command used often is `ipconfig`. This command will show the network address settings for the computer.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/ipconfig.png)  

Each command will have a help manual to explain the expected syntax to execute the command properly, along with any additional parameters that can be added to the command to expand its execution.

A  command to retrieve the help manual for a command is `/?`.

For example, to see the help manual for **ipconfig**, you can use the following command: `ipconfig /?`

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/ipconfig-help.png)  

**Note**: To clear the command prompt screen, the command is `cls`. 

The next command is `netstat`. Per the help manual, this command will display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/netstat.png)  

In the above image, the line within the red box shows us an example syntax for the command. 

The structure tells us the **netstat** command can be run alone or with parameters, such as `-a`,  `-b`,  `-e`, etc. 

When any of the parameters are appended to the root command, **netstat** in this case, the output changes. Play with a few to see for yourself. 

The `net` command is primarily used to manage network resources. This command supports sub-commands.

If you type **net** without a sub-command, the output will show the syntax for the root command showing a few of the sub-commands you can use.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/net.png)  

For the net command, to display the help manual `/?` will not work. In this case, you need to use different syntax, which is `net help`.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/net-help.png)  

So, if you wish to see the help information for `net user` , the command is `net help user`. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun2/net-help-user2.png)

You can use the same command to view the help information for other useful **net** sub-commands, such as **localgroup**, **use**, **share**, and **session**.

### User Account Control (UAC)

UAC prevents unauthorized system changes by requiring permission before allowing administrative actions. It works by giving users standard tokens initially, then prompting for elevation when administrative access is needed. This protects against malware and accidental system modifications.

UAC has four levels: Always Notify (prompts for all changes), Default (prompts for app changes), Notify without Secure Desktop (prompts without screen dimming), and Never Notify (disabled, not recommended). The shield icon indicates when administrative privileges are required.

UAC prompts appear on a secure desktop with different colors: blue for Windows components, yellow for third-party software, and red for blocked actions. Best practices include keeping UAC enabled and only approving prompts from trusted sources.

The large majority of home users are logged into their Windows systems as local administrators. Remember from the previous task that any user with administrator as the account type can make changes to the system.

A user doesn't need to run with high (elevated) privileges on the system to run tasks that don't require such privileges, such as surfing the Internet, working on a Word document, etc. This elevated privilege increases the risk of system compromise because it makes it easier for malware to infect the system. Consequently, since the user account can make changes to the system, the malware would run in the context of the logged-in user.

To protect the local user with such privileges, Microsoft introduced **User Account Control** (UAC). This concept was first introduced with the short-lived [Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista)  and continued with versions of Windows that followed.

**Note** : UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account. 

How does UAC work? When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 

Let's look at the program on the account you're currently logged into, the built-in administrator account—Right-click to view its Properties.

In the Security tab, we can see the users/groups and their permissions to this file. Notice that the standard user is not listed. 

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun1/win-wireshark.png)

Log in as the standard user and try to install this program. To do this, you can remote desktop into the machine as the standard user account. 

**Note** : You have the username and password for the standard user. It's visible in `lusrmgr.msc` .

Before installing the program, notice the icon. Do you see the difference?  When you're logged in as the standard user, the shield icon is on the program's default icon. See below.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun1/win-wireshark.png)

This shield icon is an indicator that UAC will prompt to allow higher-level privileges to install the program.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun1/win-wireshark2.png)

Double-click the program, and you'll see the UAC prompt. Notice that the built-in administrator account is already set as the user name and prompts the account's password. See below.

![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/win-fun1/win-uac.png)

After some time, if a password is not entered, the UAC prompt disappears, and the program does not install.
